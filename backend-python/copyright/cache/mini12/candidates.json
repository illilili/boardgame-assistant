The heart of the game is the &quot;BattleMech&quot; (aka Mech), a giant fighting robot; typical games have each player controlling from 1-4 Mechs.  Vehicles, infantry, power armour, aircraft and other unit types also exist.  The game system includes details such as varying weapon ranges, heat generation, and discrete hit locations (torso, arms, legs, etc.). Mechs vary greatly by mobility and firepower, and players can choose from provided designs or take the time to create their own Mechs from scratch.  The game is typically played on one or more hex mapsheets or mounted map boards; optional rules are also available for hexless play.  An extensive line of pewter figurines (Mechs, vehicles, and the like) are available from Iron Wind Metals. (Many earlier BattleTech figures were produced and sold by Ral Partha, which still handles the figure line in Europe.)\n\nAs in earlier editions of BattleTech, introductory box sets are available.  The current versions are the BattleTech: Beginner Box (contains 2 plastic Mechs, a map, and simplified quick-start Mech rules). Designed to immediately follow this is the BattleTech: A Game of Armored Combat box (8 plastic Mechs, mapsheets, cardboard Mech standees, and the full rules for Mechs and basic gear).  Lastly, the BattleTech: Clan Invasion box adds further Mechs and maps and slightly expands the rules to include more advanced technologies and unit types, while moving a player forward through the game's timeline.\n\nThe main component of the current generation of BattleTech is a series of rulebooks.  The primary ones are either Total Warfare, which covers combined arms (Mechs, combat vehicles, battle armor, aircraft etc), or the BattleTech: BattleMech Manual, which continues on from the introductory box sets in offering more advanced but still Mech-only play.  The rest of the current in-print rulebook line is covered below.\n\nBT is also supplemented by a variety of Technical Readouts, which provide gameplay and background data on Mechs and other units at various time periods in the game-universe history.  Accompanying these are pregenerated PDF record sheet collections, which have full gameplay statistics for each unit in a corresponding Technical Readout and are designed to be printed out for tabletop play.  Also common are map sets, which add additional mapsheets for scenario variety; era-based sourcebooks detailing the history and factions of the setting; and the aforementioned miniatures (which are not required for play).\n\nFor about six years the game was known as &quot;Classic BattleTech&quot;, to differentiate it from the WizKids-produced collectible miniatures game &quot;MechWarrior: Dark Age&quot;.  This branding has been long since abandoned and no longer appears on any products, but many BGG entries still feature it even if not applicable.\n\nRulebooks\n\n     Total Warfare (standard game rules for the most common unit types)\n     BattleTech: BattleMech Manual (a Mech-only rulebook, but rewritten for clarity and featuring most relevant gear from Tactical Operations and Interstellar Operations)\n     TechManual (standard unit construction)\n     Tactical Operations: Advanced Rules (advanced ground rules)\n     Tactical Operations: Advanced Units &amp; Equipment (advanced equipment and unit construction)\n     Strategic Operations: Advanced Aerospace Rules\n     BattleTech: Interstellar Operations (era-specific equipment, various strategic wargaming rulesets)\n     Campaign Operations (rules for campaigns and running your own mercenary group)\n     A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG (RPG rules)\n     A Time of War Companion (RPG supplement)\n     MechWarrior: Destiny (separate, narrative-style RPG)\n     BattleTech: Alpha Strike ??Commander's Edition (fast-play BT variant with simplified units and a higher unit count)\n\n\nIntroductory Supplements\n\n     BattleTech Technical Readout: Succession Wars\n     Record Sheets: Succession Wars\n     Map Pack: Grasslands\n     BattleTech: Technical Readout ??Clan Invasion\n     Record Sheets: Clan Invasion\n\n\nOther Supplements (partial list)\n\n     BattleTech: Chaos Campaign\n     BattleTech: Battle of Tukayyid\n     BattleTech: MapPack ??Battle of Tukayyid\n     BattleTech: Shattered Fortress\n     BattleTech: Era Report ??3052\n     BattleTech: Era Report ??3145\n     BattleTech: Field Manual ??3145\n\n\nSuperseded Rulesets (partial list)\n\n     BattleTech: CityTech\n     AeroTech: The BattleTech Game of Fighter Combat\n     AeroTech 2\n     Classic BattleTech RPG", "['Economic'] ['Commodity Speculation', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Memory', 'Modular Board', 'Pick-up and Deliver'] Collect goods and meet the demand of those ever-present cargo ships.", "['Card Game', 'Educational', 'Trivia'] ['Ordering'] Which was invented first, dynamite or the typewriter?", "['Medieval', 'Territory Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Tile Placement'] Lay tiles to build roads, cloisters, cities and farms in a snowy medieval landscape.", "['Ancient'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Modular Board', 'Set Collection', 'Worker Placement'] Unload building materials from ships, but your opponent?s plans might mess up yours.", "['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Maze'] ['Action Points', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Map Deformation', 'Modular Board'] Escape the dungeon or die trying in this head-to-head duel of wits.", "['American West', 'City Building'] ['End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Rondel', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Variable Phase Order'] Strike it rich in the frontiers of California - will you boom or bust?", "['Animals', 'Fantasy'] ['Bias', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Slide \\\\/ Push', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Track Movement'] Play as woodland spirits in this shared resource and worker placement euro game.", "['Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Medieval', 'Miniatures', 'Mythology'] ['End Game Bonuses', 'Grid Movement', 'Loans', 'Market', 'Matching', 'Movement Points'] Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here.", "['Aviation \\\\/ Flight', 'Modern Warfare', 'Wargame'] ['Area Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Plan the missions, select the team & pray the pilots return successfully?or at all.", "['Ancient', 'City Building', 'Civilization'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement', 'Variable Player Powers'] In ancient Greece, build up your population and power.

Each card depicts an historical event on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.\n\nThe first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.\n\nThemes included in Timeline: General Interest are: Discoveries, Arts, Events, Music, Inventions, Monuments, and Sports.\n\nTimeline: General Interest can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series (except Timeline: Star Wars).\n\nIntegrates with:\n\n\n    Timeline: Science & Discoveries\n    Timeline: Events\n    Timeline: Inventions\n    Timeline: Music & Cinema\n    Timeline: American History\n    Timeline: Americana", "['Ancient'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Tile Placement'] Prestige-seeking artisans and nobles gather at the genesis of an ancient world wonder", "['Civilization', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Tech Trees \\\\/ Tech Tracks', 'Variable Player Powers'] Area-control game with deckbuilding from factions that depends on board play.", "['Exploration', 'Maze', 'Spies \\\\/ Secret Agents'] ['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Avoid the guards, cameras, and other problems and try to break the casino.", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Hexagon Grid', 'Network and Route Building', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Tile Placement'] Place tiles to strategically connect routes that move treasures along a pathway.", "['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Horror'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Move Through Deck', 'Multi-Use Cards', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] A cooperative, dungeon-diving card game set in the Kinfire Chronicles universe", "['Fighting', 'Horror', 'Zombies'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Move Through Deck', 'Player Elimination'] A dice chuckin' zombie filled run along Route 66.", "['Animals', 'Card Game'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Track Movement', 'Variable Set-up'] Collect and walk all your favorite dogs in this beautiful, card-driven game.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Number'] ['Set Collection', 'Tile Placement'] Race to play all your tiles by forming runs or sets, even if they're not your own!", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game'] ['Layering', 'Set Collection', 'Tile Placement'] Build trees out of cards to make your forest spirit friends happy!", "['Animals', 'Fighting'] ['Action Points', 'Command Cards', 'Hand Management', 'Variable Player Powers'] Fight in epic battles between enormous Guardians and the clever Foxen clan!", "['Ancient', 'Economic'] ['Modular Board', 'Rondel', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up', 'Worker Placement'] As child of the pharaoh, you must prepare for the afterlife by pleasing the gods.", "['Ancient', 'Card Game', 'Mythology', 'Religious'] ['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Description from the publisher:\n\nTake on the role of Egyptian nobles at the time of the pharaohs, preparing for their death and burial in the valley of the kings.

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.\n\nIn each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.\n\nAfter revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.\n\nCombat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.\n\nWallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.\n\nNote that the box of this game states is for 2-5 players, but the game actually plays only with 3-5 players.", "['Card Game', 'Horror'] ['Closed Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Sudden Death Ending'] Draft Cards that work together to gain points....but don't lose your sanity first!", "['Economic', 'Negotiation'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Negotiation', 'Roll \\\\/ Spin and Move', 'Set Collection', 'Take That'] Negotiate your way into deals, but get too greedy and they'll cut you out!", "['Adventure', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Miniatures'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Die Icon Resolution', 'Modular Board', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers'] Dungeoneering heroes explore, discover and battle towards the final confrontation.", "['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration'] ['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid'] Become an outsider and fight against Ascend, a cold AI, that rules over the world.", "['Civilization', 'Environmental', 'Exploration', 'Prehistoric', 'Territory Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Auction', 'Cooperative Game', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Shape every facet of humankind in this sprawling, thematic civilization-builder.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Fantasy'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Use tents and totems to gain dominance over the different regions of Iwari!", "['Horror', 'Movies \\\\/ TV \\\\/ Radio theme'] ['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Variable Player Powers'] You can't defeat the Alien, so use what's at hand to keep it at bay until you escape.", "['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy'] ['Action Drafting', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Income', 'Set Collection', 'Track Movement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types'] Explore new and strange continents that have emerged from the sea.", "['Party Game', 'Real-time', 'Trivia', 'Word Game'] ['Pattern Recognition', 'Speed Matching'] Card matching with words on the tip of your tongue...", "['Economic', 'Trains', 'Transportation'] ['Connections', 'Crayon Rail System', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver'] Connect the north, east, south, and west in this pick-up-and-deliver train classic.", "['Card Game', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers'] Dice Throne is a game of intriguing dice, tactical card play, powerful heroes, and unique abilities.\n\nIt's a fast-paced 2-6 player combat game (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 2v2v2, or free-for-all).

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.\n\n    \n\n\nYomi is a card game that simulates a fighting game. It tests your ability to predict how your opponents will act and your ability to judge the relative value of cards from one situation to the next. Also, it lets you do fun combos and be a panda. There are 10 characters to choose from, each with their own deck, abilities, and style. Each deck also doubles as a regular deck of playing cards with beautiful artwork (the complete game features a whopping 120 different character illustrations).\n\nYomi is the Japanese word for &ldquo;reading&rdquo;, in this case as in reading the mind of your opponent. Yomi: Fighting Card Game is a simple competitive card game that simulates a fight between two characters. Each deck in Yomi represents one character, with 10 decks in the first release.\n\nChampion fighting game tournament player and tournament organizer David Sirlin designed the game to test the skills of Valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to guess which moves your opponent will make. There is more to it than guessing, though: some players have the uncanny ability to &ldquo;guess&rdquo; right almost every time, no matter the game.\n\nThe core mechanic is a paper-rock-scissors guessing game between attack, throw, and block/dodge (sometimes modified by special ability cards). Attacks and throws usually let you follow up with combo cards from your hand, while blocks let you draw a card. While it first seems &quot;just random,&quot; you soon discover that the unequal and uncertain payoffs in this guessing game allow you really read what the opponent will do. Yomi captures the kind of mind games that occur during the high level in fighting game tournaments.\n\nReimplemented by:\n\n     Yomi (Second Edition)", "['American West', 'Card Game'] ['Push Your Luck'] Make the right bets and rob your opponents to be the Legend of the West.", "['Arabian', 'Dice', 'Medieval'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Track Movement', 'Worker Placement'] Invent, build, test, and publish your ingenious devices.", "['Card Game', 'Economic', 'Prehistoric'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Negotiation', 'Simulation', 'Worker Placement'] Hunt fauna and learn culture as early humans, to survive the European Ice Age.", "['Dice'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building', 'Open Drafting', 'Pick-up and Deliver'] Deliver goods, build the city and your tableau using a unique dice selection method.", "['Ancient'] ['Set Collection', 'Tile Placement'] Archaeologists compete to exhibit the best collection in the museum.", "['Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing', 'Medieval'] ['End Game Bonuses', 'Market', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Turn Order', 'Turn Order'] Gather resources and manage your forge to craft swords that will please the shogun.", "['Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing', 'Puzzle', 'Real-time'] ['Hexagon Grid', 'Network and Route Building', 'Real-Time', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Tile Placement'] Build a frenetic factory to most efficiently convert between different resources.", "['Card Game', 'Real-time'] ['Pattern Building', 'Race', 'Real-Time', 'Score-and-Reset Game', 'Speed Matching'] Be the first to play all of your cards in this fast-paced solitaire style game.", "['Transportation'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Worker Placement'] Sculpt and help erect Moai statues in Easter island!", "['Science Fiction'] ['Action Points', 'Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management'] A group of cyberpunk hackers team up to shut down a mind-controlling AI.", "['Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Puzzle'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Narrative Choice \\\\/ Paragraph', 'Storytelling'] You awaken in a dungeon with no memory of how you got there.

With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game. The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 2-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&quot;\n\nPlayers take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development. Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, which depicts Greece and Atlantis, which lets you conquer territories and thereby acquire resources.\n\nDevelopment takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.\n\nA player's piety is measured by discoveries, and the most pious player might be rewarded during the game by one of the nine gods included. Similarly, the less pious players might be punished by those same gods.\n\nThe replayability of Olympos is huge, says Demaegd, as the discovery board and gods in play will be different each game, not to mention the territories you're able to conquer.", "['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Video Game Theme'] ['Action \\\\/ Event', 'Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Events', 'Grid Coverage', 'Grid Movement'] Work together to remove binding crystals and heal the ailing leviathans.", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Hand Management', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement'] Match double sided hexes and your lowest scored shape is your final score.", "['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction'] ['Chit-Pull System', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting'] A cooperative deck building game with an easy setup and no shuffling required", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Animals'] ['Commodity Speculation', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Map Reduction', 'Modular Board', 'Set Collection', 'Track Movement'] Ants must find the right sequence of foods in order to become the king of the hill!", "['Fantasy'] ['Action Drafting', 'Contracts', 'Set Collection', 'Take That', 'Variable Phase Order'] Collect and combine devices to be the best inventor in a fantastic world.", "['Deduction', 'Puzzle', 'Real-time'] ['Cooperative Game'] Solve puzzles to discover the mystery of the Ice Cave!", "['American Indian Wars', 'American West', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame'] ['Campaign \\\\/ Battle Card Driven', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Avoid being subjugated by either the Spanish, Mexicans or the Americans.", "['American West', 'Card Game', 'City Building', 'Fantasy', 'Horror'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Hand Management', 'Variable Player Powers'] Players fight for influence and control in a demon-haunted Old West town.", "['Card Game', 'Educational', 'Trivia'] ['Ordering'] Find the right spot in the increasing long timeline for each of your discoveries.", "['Deduction', 'Party Game', 'Word Game'] ['Induction', 'Player Judge'] Figure out the &quot;rules&quot; for each ring in the Venn diagram by playing object cards!", "['Science Fiction', 'Wargame'] ['Action Drafting', 'Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid'] Six asymmetric factions battle for control of ancient relics on the planet of Ryh.", "['City Building'] ['Bingo', 'Contracts', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Pattern Building', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Design the most appealing 1950s neighborhood, with fences, parks, and swimming pools.", "['Fantasy', 'Real-time'] ['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Real-Time', 'Tile Placement'] Build and re-build magical cities under an ever-increasing time pressure.", "['Science Fiction'] ['Action Queue', 'Contracts', 'Set Collection', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Worker Placement'] Send your divers to collect treasures in the depths of post-apocalyptic oceans.", "['Economic', 'Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Team-Based Game'] Re-fight WWII on a global scale with plastic soldiers, tanks, planes, and ships!", "['Horror', 'Murder \\\\/ Mystery', 'Novel-based', 'Political', 'Spies \\\\/ Secret Agents', 'Zombies'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Hidden Roles', 'Open Drafting'] Victorian agents seek to protect- or overthrow the Great Old Ones among us.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Dice', 'Puzzle'] ['Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Open Drafting', 'Resource Queue'] Noctiluca shine beautifully at night.

During the height of the city&rsquo;s powers, rivals, thieves and would-be conquerors were locked away in the sprawling dungeon known as the Nightvault. After the city&rsquo;s fall, Nagash broke open the chains that bound the shackled spirits within, giving them weapons to freeze the hearts of the living and enough memory of their torment to fill them with hatred and jealousy. The spectral dead delight in the chance to inflict this hatred upon the living, and the streets of Shadespire echo to the sounds of terrifying screams and cruel, mocking laughter...\n\nThe Game\n\nIn Warhammer Underworlds, you and your opponent pick a warband &ndash; 2 are included in this box &ndash; and build a deck of power and objective cards. After placing your warband on the hex-tiled game boards, you take turns making actions &ndash; movement and attacks &ndash; until 3 phases are played. Between actions, you can use the power cards to introduce effects and reactions that can swing the battle in your favour; building the best deck you can and using cunning to deploy these abilities at the perfect time is the secret to mastering the game and dominating your foe.

The goal of the game is to become the most famous patron of the arts by hiring the most famous artists of the period and financing their works.\n\nEach player can commission artworks in his own district, the Cathedral, or in the civic buildings of the city. Each artwork requires money and resources to complete. To earn the money and resources the artists need, the players send their workers to labor in various workshops, possibly even in their opponents&rsquo; districts. Additional workers can be earned by offering charity to the church. During the game, players will earn prestige points, primarily by completing artworks. Prestige points can be spent during the game, but at the end of the game they will be the player&rsquo;s primary source of victory points.\n\nAll of the characters in the game are real historical figures that lived and worked in Italy during the Renaissance. Most of them worked in Florence. All of the buildings in the game were real Renaissance workshops. The artworks the players can complete include the masterpieces of some of the most famous artists in the world.\n\nNote from the designers directly from the rulebook:\n\n&quot;We apologize if we included some characters in the game who never worked in Florence during the Renaissance, but we wanted to include all of the most important artists (in our opinion) from that golden age of Italian art and culture. Michelangelo, for example, left an important mark on the history of the city&mdash;and the Renaissance period&mdash;even if he was only in Florence for a short time. We also added some portraits of military leaders (created by Ivan Zoni) to the rulebook. They are not involved in the game, but they were influential members of public life during this era.\nThe names of the buildings, parts of the Cathedral, and the workshops are in the literal form they had in Italy during the 1400-1600 period. Some of them are unchanged in the modern Italian language, some have changed a little, and others have completely disappeared or remain only in some dialects. We chose to maintain those words, without translating them into a language that the real artists didn&rsquo;t know. We hope you agree with our choice, and we hope you have a good time playing Florenza!&quot;", "['Fantasy', 'Mythology'] ['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection', 'Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types'] Become the head of a tribe of Druids about to unlock the secrets of the Arch-Oak.", "['Ancient', 'Mythology'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Set Collection'] Others help you build the wonders of the ancient world -- say no at your peril!", "['Modern Warfare', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame'] ['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Simulation'] America invaded by 3 nefarious foes in a futuristic conflict played with miniatures!", "['City Building', 'Economic', 'Fantasy'] ['Action Retrieval', 'Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Follow', 'Hand Management', 'Network and Route Building'] Lay the foundations of Gloomhaven as you strive to be the most renowned builder.", "['Ancient', 'Civilization', 'Environmental', 'Medieval', 'Wargame'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Multiple Maps', 'Simulation', 'Tech Trees \\\\/ Tech Tracks'] Use military might or diplomacy, feed your people and lead your civilization to glory", "['Civilization', 'Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers'] High Frontier (3rd edition) is a space exploration game by Phil Eklund.

Tales of disparate champions good and evil, brought together by naught more than fate, battling against sanity-shredding horrors in the ever-shifting domain of the Gaunt Summoner of Tzeentch. Tales of bravery, heroism, treachery and betrayal. Tales of teamwork, success, and glory-hunting failure.\n\nSome who tackle the Silver Tower seek a boon from the Gaunt Summoner, others wish to learn his true name, that they might destroy him. All must face foul, writhing monsters, bizarre, labyrinthine corridors bristling with traps and strange, maddening riddles before they even gain the chance to stand before his fell sorcery. The greatest champions, those who grow in strength over time as they solve the Silver Tower&rsquo;s secrets, even they may fall at this hurdle &ndash; yet the riches, power and freedom they could gain drive them ever forward.

The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.\n\nHistory\nThe term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.\n\nThe Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.\nLike the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.\n\nWhat's in the box?\nGang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com\n\nGameplay\nAll the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.\n\nInspired by Big Two", "['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Humor'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Hand Management', 'Take That', 'Variable Phase Order'] Are we turning Japanese?

The board is two-sided, and hurdles are provided so that players can choose flat racing or steeplechases (races with fences that the horses must jump).\n\nPlayers each have their own deck of 32 movement cards, dice and a horse of their own colour.  Ten cards are randomly selected for each race, with two cards left over which can be drawn for use in any one race.  Cards played in a race are removed from the game.\n\nA round consists of two parts.  First all players simultaneously select a card and move the number on the played card (if able), in position order.  After this, a single pair of dice is rolled by one player (the rolling player rotates throughout the game).  The player rolling the dice decides if all horses move the value of one or both of the dice and all horses move (again in position order).\n\nLike a real horse race, inside position is important.  The game has rules for lane changing, blocking and handicaps on the leaders which restrict the values of the cards the players whose horses are in the first three spots are able to play, or how much (or even IF) a horse in one of those spots can move on a dice roll.  To try to counter this, players have &quot;joker&quot; cards which can be used to avoid being handicapped when in one of the first three spots.  The steeplechase introduces additional rules for jumping fences.  Horses can be forced to pull up short of a fence (because they are blocked on the other side and have nowhere to land safely) or can occasionally fall if their movement ends on a fence - which takes four movement points to jump.  Players will need to plan their moves carefully to prevent other players from getting their full amount of movement, and to avoid having players doing that to them.\n\nThe first four horses to finish each race are awarded points towards their final total.\n\nThe game comes in two versions.  The regular version which has single-colour plastic horses, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; version which has hand-painted pewter horses (each jockey wears a different coloured jersey) - each in a little protective case.

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.\n First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).\n\nWith First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so.

It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.\n\nNineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.\n\nPlay of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game.

You've raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you're back in our homeland, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.\n\nNow you've taken to the high seas aboard The Crimson Drake, a sturdy sailing vessel that the heroes you know and love use when their adventures take them to sea. Join the crew in the Captain Whitehawk's cabin for a pint and try to keep your sea legs!\n\n\n    Captain Whitehawk: Captain Whitehawk is the stalwart master of the Crimson Drake. She's a natural leader with years of experience and a wit as sharp as her saber. She&rsquo;ll take the crew to hell and back for adventure and loot, and make damn sure they have a roaring good time while they're at it.\n    First Mate Remy: An elf from faraway lands, Remy is an honor-bound swashbuckler who keeps the crew in line; he&rsquo;ll be the first to step in and break up a fight.

With her knack for seeing the future, she is an invaluable, if unlikely, navigator for the Crimson Drake. After predicting countless storms and monster attacks she has earned the trust of Captain Whitehawk and her crew.\n\n\nThe Red Dragon Inn 4 includes a Sea Event Deck that provides a new way to play RDI. Instead of the relative safety of the inn, players are now partying in the Captain's cabin aboard the Crimson Drake &ndash; and because you're out on an adventure, the party runs the risk of being interrupted by random encounters. In game terms, at the start of the game you shuffle the Sea Event Deck and place it in the middle of the table with two Progress Counters on it. You then play RDI like normal, but at the end of each player's turn, that player removes a Progress Counter from the Sea Event Deck. When you remove the last Progress Counter, reveal the top card and an Event takes place. The Sea Event Deck adds a new level of complexity to the base game. Not only will you need to protect yourself from the other players, as well as the Drink Deck, but you may find yourself forced to defend against a Sea Event.

(Copper Kettle, or since it's about witches, Copper Cauldron Co.) we imagine witches or wizards shopping for ingredients for their magic potions.  Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of cards (ingredients) and you pick one from the row or column where you stop.  The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.  You try to collect sets of four matching ingredients and get penalty points if you have only one of a particular ingredient.  The scoring rules can be made more complicated if the players desire, but for most the basic rules are satisfying.  A touch of memory is involved since you can see only the last ingredient you picked up on your stack of cards.\n\n\nGame Summary\nCreate a 6x6 grid of ingredient cards (numbered 1-4, 14 ingredient types; 2 each in 5 colors, and the player colors black and white) minus the corners. Place the 2 player pawns on opposite corners. Each player gets a random card (not of their color) in front of them. For the advanced game, players also get 2 recipe cards = bonus points at end of game if you meet the conditions (e.g., at least 3 cards of both ingredients in a color; fewer 4s than the other player, etc.).\n\nOn your turn, move clockwise as many spaces around the grid as the number showing on your card stack, then take a card in that row and place on top of your stack (may never look through your stack) -- if land on corner, get nothing. Place the top card from the draw deck in the empty spot. If you drew a card with a magic hat/wand icon, take a second turn (max 2 consecutive turns). If you got a card with an exploding icon, the other player places their top card on the bottom of the draw deck (if deck empty, remove card from game instead).\n\nThe game ends when any row is empty. Then sort your cards by ingredient type and score according to number of each type:\n- 1 = negative points\n- 2 = 0\n- 3 = sum\n- 4 = sum + 5 (i.e., 15 VP)\n- then, if in your own color, double the value\n- score any bonus points from end-game recipes.\nMost points wins!", "['Card Game', 'Science Fiction'] ['Hand Management', 'Set Collection'] Play cards and alter the rules in this ever changing sci-fi themed card game!", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Area Movement'] Attract wealthy customers & place stalls in the choicest locations in London.", "['Bluffing', 'Negotiation', 'Political', 'Renaissance', 'Wargame'] ['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Player Elimination', 'Simulation', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers'] Power politics, rebellion, assassination and war in Renaissance Italy.", "['Educational', 'Travel'] ['Connections', 'Hand Management'] Learn geography while you play, collecting sequential cards that traverse Africa.", "[] ['Hand Management', 'Trick-taking'] With just 12 cards?err, chips, try to win the most points.

First, the king and his knights move around the board securing their position or eliminating dangers by pushing aside the crowd, then the assassins hidden among the crowd prepare for their lethal strike by killing guards or making the king's progress slower.

It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.\n\nIn Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!\n\nThe game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.\n\nThe game ends in one of three ways:\n- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately\n- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)\n- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500. If there are no black cattle (because the Byrd player has them, or through drought) then they are worth nothing. The player with the highet total wins.\n\nOn a players turn, they choose a colour of longhorn present in their location and steal all of that colour.

from the publisher:\n\nDarkness envelops the world; chaos reigns. Humanity fights back in the only way they know how -- with forceful control. But how does one control creatures whose existence defies all logic?\n\nNightfall: Martial Law is a stand-alone game that can be integrated with the hit competitive deck-building game Nightfall. Martial Law brings you a complete new set of cards with special powers, and features all-new vampires, werewolves, hunters and ghouls. Martial Law also introduces the feeding mechanism: Feed your chained orders to give them greater effect!\n\nEach card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.\n\nCards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.\n\nThe object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!", "['Space Exploration'] ['Simulation', 'Worker Placement'] Create and shape your solar system!", "['Card Game', 'Economic'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Auction', 'Closed Economy Auction', 'Constrained Bidding', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting'] Merchants in Byzantium who make the smartest trades will reap the most profit.", "['Card Game', 'Novel-based'] ['Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Team-Based Game'] Collect the most extravagant hats and become the talk of the tea party.", "['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Game System'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Role Playing', 'Storytelling'] Another board-game format introduction to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons RPG.

These basic/starter boxed sets attempt to bridge the gap between miniatures board games, miniatures war games, and role-playing games by using a board-and-counter/miniature format with simplified versions of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules.\n\nThis entry returns to cardboard counters used in the 2000 &quot;Adventure Game&quot; version, after a couple &quot;Basic Game&quot; versions using miniatures released in 2004 and 2006; this version updates the rules set to D&amp;D 4th Edition, and continues the tradition of including completely new adventures and selections of monsters and pre-generated player characters, but is otherwise virtually the same product as its predecessors, and this line of games would be joined in 2010 by yet another updated, &quot;Red Box&quot; 4th Edition Essentials basic/starter game version.\n\nAll these basic/starter games are direct fore-runners of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure System&quot; boardgames (&quot;Castle Ravenloft&quot; and &quot;Wrath of Ashardalon&quot;), which are still simplified versions of the D&amp;D rules set using tile-based game boards and miniatures.\n\nThe box cover of this version says &quot;2-5 players&quot;, but there are enough included materials for 6 players (5 pre-generated Player-Characters, and one Dungeon Master.)\n\nDungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Sets:\n2nd Edition: The New Easy to Master Dungeons & Dragons and Introduction to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\n3rd Edition/3.5 Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game\n4th Edition: Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set\n\n5th edition is an RPG item: Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set", "['Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Negotiation'] ['Hidden Roles', 'Roles with Asymmetric Information', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Team-Based Game', 'Voting'] Big Box edition of the classic social deduction game of hidden loyalty!", "['Ancient', 'Wargame'] ['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Minimap Resolution', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Do you have what it takes to conquer?or will the Oracle's predictions go unfulfilled?", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Puzzle', 'Territory Building'] ['Hand Management', 'Tile Placement'] Build together a luxuriant topiary.

Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!\n\nGameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.\n\nThe Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.\n\nPlay is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).\n\nThe Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.\n\nGame End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.\n\nA rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers.

FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.\n\nVolume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.\n\nFAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.\n\n\n     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. \n\n\n\n     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. \n\n\n\n     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. \n\n\n\n     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. \n\n\nAnother strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.\n\nSeries Designer: Rick Young\nSeries Developer: John Foley\nPublished: 2007\nOnline Play\n\n\n     Wargameroom (real-time)", "['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Racing', 'Science Fiction', 'Sports', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Impulse Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Movement Points', 'Role Playing'] Drive offensively!

After this kind of movement every racer can add a paying movement. Therefore, the race is based on the riders&rsquo; energy management: initially the riders are all inside the peloton, where it is easier to save energy, but then they will have to find the proper moment to break away to open the definitive gap ahead of the peloton.\n\nThe slipstreaming rule assures the simulation of the easier breaking away with a fellow, saving energy by swapping places.

The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.\n\nThe identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.\n\nAdd in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing.

As the new game changes the map of the original, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.\n\nM&eacute;gawatts is the French release of the Friedemann Friese game Power Grid. The French edition is produced by Filosofia.\n\nAs with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.\n\nHowever, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.\n\nAdditionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.\n\nIt differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.\n\nThe Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.\n\nThe ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.\n\n Re-Implements: \n\n\n     Power Grid\n     Funkenschlag\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n\n     Power Grid: France/Italy\n     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe\n     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)\n     Power Grid: The New Power Plants ??Set 1\n     Power Grid: China/Korea\n     Power Grid: Flux Generator\n\n\nThe expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards.

Tiles come in five colors numbered 0-10, and when you place the second tile of a color, you lock in whether you're ascending or descending in that color. For example, if you take a blue 2, then a blue 4, you can place only blue 5-10 in the future. Some tiles have a symbol that grant you another turn immediately.\n\nWhen the final tile is flipped, the game ends after that player finishes their turn. If you've collected only 1-2 tiles of a color, you lose points; the same applies if you collect fewer than two &quot;wishing stones&quot;, a symbol scattered across multiple colors.

Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.\n\nThe active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:\n1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). \n2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.\n3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. \nNote: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.\n\nYou score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.\n\nThe game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.\n\nNote: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.\n\nAdvanced rules\n\nA windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.", "['Deduction', 'Horror'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Constrained Bidding', 'Deduction', 'Paper-and-Pencil'] Find the treasures and beware the specters in this haunted manor treasure hunt.", "['Horror', 'Murder \\\\/ Mystery', 'Party Game', 'Puzzle'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Deduction', 'Real-Time', 'Storytelling'] Solve the murders, prevent your own!", "['City Building'] ['Hand Management', 'Tile Placement'] Build the famous riverfront of Porto, in a fast, tactical and interactive game.", "['Medieval', 'Nautical'] ['Set Collection', 'Track Movement'] Recruit vikings to raid villages and defeat monsters for the most glory.", "['Party Game', 'Trivia', 'Word Game'] ['Team-Based Game'] Describe words to your team as quick as possible.", "['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Video Game Theme'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Roll \\\\/ Spin and Move'] War rages between two factions vying for control of Columbia.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Ancient', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Hexagon Grid'] Viking clans call upon the power of mythical beings to gain control of Midgard.", "['Card Game', 'Religious'] ['Trick-taking'] Take tricks to follow the edict, or break the rules for a big payoff.

The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games.

Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting.

You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike too light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.\n\nWelcome to the Vietnam Air War!\n\nEach of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.\n\nEach mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.\n\nEach of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.\n\nFor those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;\n\nThe freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.\n\nEvery target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value. [this last sentence is not in fact true for the game, though it appears in the game blurb; confirmed by the author]\n\nThis means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.\n\nAnother difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.\n\nThey soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.\n\nFor example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.\n\nSo, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!\n\nComponents: \n\n     110 Full color Cards \n         12 F-4 Phantom IIs (USAF) \n         8 F-105 Thunderchiefs (USAF)\n         2 F-105G Wild Weasels (USAF)\n         4 F-100 Super Sabers (USAF) \n         2 F-104A Starfighters (USAF)\n         1 EB-66 Destroyer (USAF)\n         8 F-4 Phantom IIs (USN) \n         6 A-4 Skyhawks (USN)\n         5 A-7 Corsair II (USN) \n         5 A-6 Intruders (USN) \n         4 F-8 Crusaders (USN)\n         1 EA-6A Electric Intruder (USN) \n         34 Targets \n         18 Special Events \n    \n     Full Color, 20-page Rulebook \n     Full Color Double-sided Counter Sheet (176 x 5/8&quot; counters) \n     6 Full Color Campaign Sheets \n         War in the South (1965) USAF &amp; USN\n         Rolling Thunder (1967) USAF &amp; USN\n         Linebacker (1972) USAF &amp; USN\n    \n     3 Full Color Player Aid Cards \n         Tactical Display\n         Card Diplay Sheet\n         Help Sheet\n    \n     1 Ten-sided die \n     1 Player Log master (to be photocopied prior to play)\n\n\nOther Leader series games by Dan Verssen\n\nRe-implemented by:\n\n    Phantom Leader: Deluxe Edition", "['American West', 'Comic Book \\\\/ Strip'] ['Area Movement', 'Cooperative Game', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] A deck building adventure game set in the weird west.", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] The Bulge with a truly innovative and unique system.", "['Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers'] Dust is a strategy board game of conquest and control. Seize power sources and capitals, develop your infrastructure, and build and wield vast, high-tech armies in your bid for global domination.\n\nPlayers will probably recognize the map as that of Earth, but what they will not see are any borders or nations. In the world of Dust, the unending war and the new technologies have altered the political face of Earth beyond all recognition.\n\nAt the beginning of each turn, players select a card from their hand. This card represents their strategy for the coming turn and to a large extent dictates the actions a player can take.\n\nDuring their production phase, players spend production points to buy additional factories and units. Each individual unit type has its own unique statistics and effects, so players have to carefully consider the composition of their armies.\n\nIn combat, players alternate rolling dice and destroying units until one side has been eliminated (either due to casualties or retreats) or a cease-fire is declared.\n\nAt the end of each game round, players score victory points for power sources, capitals, and majorities they control. The player who controls the most land areas earns bonus victory points, as does the player who controls the most sea areas and the player who controls the most production centers. The first player to amass a set number of victory points while also controlling a capital is the winner.\n\nOnly once a player has amassed at least half the victory points required to win can he or she attack an enemy capital. Once the war has been so escalated, however, then all players are free to attack capitals.\n\nDust English Rules Premium Version http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Dust/Dust_Rulebook_Prem_Eng.pdf\nDust English Rules Epic Version http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Dust/Dust_Rulebook_Epic_Enig.pdf\nBackstage http://www.kaleidosgames.com", "['Nautical', 'Travel'] ['Network and Route Building'] Save your tribe from volcanic eruption and sail routes to inhabit unexplored islands.", "['Dice', 'Medieval'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection'] Marshal your resources to build the best castle while fending off barbarians.", "['Card Game', 'Mafia'] ['Hand Management', 'Player Elimination', 'Take That'] Rub out your opponents' mobs before they do the same to you.", "['Deduction', 'Humor', 'Murder \\\\/ Mystery'] ['Deduction', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Variable Set-up'] Try to solve a murder while covering up your own.", "['Video Game Theme'] ['Action Drafting', 'Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection'] Transport yourself to the early 90's to be the 16-bit video game champion!", "['Card Game', 'Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing'] ['Action Retrieval', 'Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Set Collection', 'Variable Player Powers'] Your team of inventors competes to create history's most significant inventions.", "['Ancient', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Line of Sight', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation'] Wargame simulation of the art of war in the Roman republic, 275-197 BC.", "['Exploration', 'Horror', 'Video Game Theme'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers'] Escape the trial as a survivor, or hunt other players as a supernatural killer.", "['Economic', 'Exploration', 'Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing', 'Number'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Area Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Worker Placement'] Drilling deep into the Earth?s crust.", "['Adventure', 'Ancient', 'Book', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval'] ['Campaign \\\\/ Battle Card Driven', 'Connections', 'Line Drawing', 'Movement Points', 'Narrative Choice \\\\/ Paragraph', 'Paper-and-Pencil'] A solo dark adventure with tactical tabletop combat played within a book.", "['Collectible Components', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Line of Sight', 'Measurement Movement', 'Modular Board', 'Simulation'] The year is 1947.

Meanwhile, the police is investigating the counterfeiting industry, quickly making lower quality counterfeited money useless.\n\nPlayers each have three animal pawns and place them in turn order, immediately executing the associated action. Players can buy component cards on the black market, improving their opportunities for both printing fake money and processing it. Of course, players will exchange their fake money for real money and try to keep it away from the godfather by putting it away in an offshore account...\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy'] ['Hand Management', 'Tile Placement'] Collect a set of seven dragons, using secret goals and action cards to win the game!", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Mancala'] Move your seeds strategically to capture your opponents' seeds.", "['Dice', 'Educational', 'Political'] ['Action Points', 'Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Betting and Bluffing', 'Cooperative Game', 'Grid Movement', 'Hidden Roles'] Take back the streets of your city in the ultimate edition of the insurrection game.", "['Deduction', 'Movies \\\\/ TV \\\\/ Radio theme', 'Spies \\\\/ Secret Agents'] ['Memory', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Voting'] Homeland: The Game is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue, deception and hidden agendas.

Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.\n\nBut the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.\n\nMorning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.\n\nThis is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.\n\nVastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.

Players take on the role of heroes trying to assemble an arsenal of equipment in order to vanquish a series of monsters that they will encounter.\n\nThe game begins with all players choosing one of five heroes each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each player fights their own monster; this is not a cooperative game. The monster each hero will likely face is revealed to them before players draft cards for their equipment.  An interesting aspect in this game is you may, if the conditions are right, evade a monster in front of you, and pass it to the hero next to you. But be aware if you do this you have to fight the monster you draw next!\n\nPlayers then select an equipment card drafted from a hand of cards, and pass the remainder of the hand to your left to prepare for battle with the monster in front of them. The equipment draft continues in this manner until only one card is left in each hand, which is discarded.  Players then compare their drafted equipment to their monster to determine the result of the battle!  The game consists of 3 levels filled with monsters to slay and new equipment to pick up.\n\nPlayers need Legend Points to win the game!

The game is based on the highly successful Commands &amp; Colors game system, where the Command cards drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. Commands &amp; Colors Tricorne - The American Revolution, however, introduces many new game concepts, which will add historical depth and provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors player many new play experiences and challenges.\n\nThe scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger American Revolution battles, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. In some scenarios, an infantry unit may represent an entire brigade, while in others a unit may only represent a few companies of soldiers. Still the linear tactics of the period, that you will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various American Revolution Armies of the day, and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought. To further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the British and Continental forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards.\n\nPlayers, that are familiar with other Commands &amp; Colors games, will soon note that unit combat losses in a Tricorne game are typically not as great as other games covered in the Commands &amp; Colors series. This is a direct result of the linear tactic fighting style of the armies that fought during the American Revolution. Unit morale is the main thematic focus in a Tricorne battle as it was historically. Knowing that an entire unit, that has only taken minimal losses when forced to retreat, may actually break and rout from the battlefield, will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.\n\nThe 12 battles, showcased in the scenario section of this booklet, feature a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. These scenarios are a smattering of some of the better-known engagements of the American Revolution.\n\nBunker Hill -17 June 1775\nLong Island (Grant's Attack) - 27 August 1776\nLong Island (British Flank March) - 27 August 1776\nFreeman's Farm - 19 September 1777\nBemis Heights - 7 October 1777\nBemis Heights (British Redoubts) - 7 October 1777\nMonmouth - 28 June 1778\nCamden - 16 August 1780\nCowpens - 17 January 1781\nGuilford Courthouse - 15 March 1781\nHobkirk's Hill - 25 April 1781\nEutaw Springs - 8 September 1781", "[\"Children's Game\"] ['Cooperative Game', 'Team-Based Game'] Use will-o'-the-wisps to push your sorcerers' apprentices down the mountain first.", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', 'Party Game'] ['Betting and Bluffing', 'Flicking', 'Stacking and Balancing'] Compete in Ninja-Mini-Games to be the best student.", "['Economic'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Auction', 'Grid Coverage', 'Pattern Building', 'Pattern Recognition'] Brinkmanship bidding and savvy chip placement win this 4-in-a-row easy auction game.", "['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Variable Player Powers'] Brutal Gang Warfare in the 'Warhammer 40K' Universe.", "['Deduction', 'Murder \\\\/ Mystery'] ['Deduction', 'Induction', 'Movement Points', 'Questions and Answers', 'Roles with Asymmetric Information', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game'] Detective Noire Thriller - 2-4 players - serial killer vs the detectives!", "['Economic', 'Trains', 'Transportation'] ['Crayon Rail System', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver'] &quot;British Rails is the game of railroad construction and operation across the narrow confines of the home of railroading, Great Britain.

They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.\n\nThe balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.\n\nMunchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;. It includes Undead and Shark monsters, which follow special rules.\n\nThe game comes with 180 cards (92 Doors, 76 Treasures, 12 Seals). The Seal cards are a different size than the regular cards--they're square and are shorter but wider (2.75&quot; x 2.75&quot;).

Good thing one planet's trash is another planet's treasure! In Junk Orbit, you're captain of your own scavenger ship, picking up space junk and transporting it to any city that will take it. Launch your junk ... uh, *cargo* ... out of your airlock to propel your ship! Race to deliver your cargo as you navigate the orbits of nearby planets and moons! It's astrodynamics for fun and profit! On your turn, carry out these three steps:\n\n1. Launch junk &mdash; Choose any one junk tile in your cargo hold and move it away from your ship (clockwise or counter-clockwise, your choice) a number of spaces equal to its numeric value. If it reaches its destination city this way, you have made a remote delivery. Otherwise, it simply comes to rest after moving its full distance. It is also possible to hit an enemy ship with launched junk, causing that opponent to discard one junk tile from their cargo.\n\n2. Move ship &mdash; Your ship must now move the same distance that your launched junk did, but in the opposite direction. When your ship reaches a transfer point between location boards, you may choose to switch orbits. If you do, your ship changes direction (from clockwise to counter-clockwise, or vice versa) as it enters the new orbit. If the space your ship lands on is the destination of any junk in your cargo, you have made a direct delivery.\n\n3. Pick up junk &mdash; After moving your ship, pick up all junk tiles present in your current city, adding them to your cargo hold.

After placing an animal, the player moves Noah to a different ferry; if he played a female animal, Noah goes to either adjacent ferry, while if he played a male, Noah goes to either ferry on the other side of the circle.\n\nIf a player can't legally play an animal, he must first take in hand all the animals on the ferry where Noah is located, then play an animal.\n\nIn addition to moving Noah to a nearly full ferry, players have two other ways to benefit themselves or mess with other players. If a player plays an animal of the same species as the one last played on that ferry (regardless of gender), he moves Noah, then takes another turn. If a player brings the weight of a ferry to exactly 21, that ferry launches from shore to meet the ark located in distant waters, a new ferry becomes available for loading, and the player distributes 1&ndash;4 cards from his hand among his opponents. finally, some cards have special animals, such as the giraffe that lets you peek at an opponent's hand and the woodpecker, which stupidly pokes holes in the ferry and reduces its maximum weight to 13.

Additional money can be earned by building factories in each city, but these are limited in number.\n\nDuring the course of the game players will take turns buying and/or using plane tickets to move about the board's nine cities. A number of tickets are displayed in rows, divided into two types: The more expensive scheduled flights which allow you to move directly to the printed city, or move your token a number of city spaces orthogonally on the board. Cheaper charter flights allow movement directly between the two city spaces printed on the ticket. You may buy tickets at any time during your turn, and you are not required to move but must do so before taking any regular actions; you may also use any many tickets in a turn as you wish.\n\nThe regular actions include building hotels and factories. Hotels are built on a u-shaped track. When a hotel is built on a red space the building that is oldest/furthest back on the track is removed. Players with the first and second most hotels on the track will be the only ones to score, with ties broken by the player with the earliest bulding on the track. There are only two factory spaces per city, and they will score points equal to the second place of the hotel scoring. In lieu of any actions or flying, or if you simply have no money, you may also take out loans; this removes your token from the board and forces you to use the more costly scheduled flights to return to the board.\n\nAt the start of the game players are given all of their factories. Each round players are given a set number of hotels in addition to any they have left over from the previous round. When any player has built all of the hotels in front of them a scoring occurs.

Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.\n\nLink to Trailer http://www.queen-games.de/index.php?id=2537----2\n\nPlay Differences from Alhambra\nAlhambra advanced. Play is the same: buy a building tile, take money or remodel. If you buy a tile for the exact amount, you can take another action, same as in Alhambra. The differences: new building types, building values are dynamic, two-sided tiles, and moats instead of walls.\n\nThere are 9 building types in Granada. Unlike Alhambra, the buildings do not have a set value. Instead, building value is determined by the count of that type of building in all players' cities times a multiplier. As in Alhambra, there are 3 scoring rounds during which each building type is examined and points awarded for the player with the majority of that type of building. In the first scoring round, A, only the player with the most tiles of a particular building type scores for that building type (1 times the total count). In the second scoring round, B, the top 2 players score (2 times the total count and 1 times the total count respectively), and in the final round, the top 3 score (3x, 2x, and 1x the total count of that building type). Scoring for a &quot;Beginners Game&quot; is a little different.\n\nThere are no ties in Granada: points are never divided like in Alhambra. In the case of two players having the same number of tiles of a particular type in their cities, the player with the highest valued tile of that type wins, and the other player takes next place. So, in Granada, it pays to buy the more expensive buildings.\n\nFor example: When the A round-scoring card is turned up, Cindy has 2 Schools, Diana has 2, Tim has 1, Tina and Bailey each have 0, for a total of 5 Schools currently in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Diana's is a 7. So, in round A, Cindy would score 1 x 5 = 5 points.\n\nWhen the B round-scoring card is turned up, the count for Schools is: Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina and Bailey 0 each for a total of 6 Schools. So, Diana scores 2 x 6 = 12 points and Cindy scores 1 x 6 = 6 points.\n\nIn the final round, the School count is Cindy 2, Diana 3, Tim 1, Tina 2, Bailey 0 for a total of 8 Schools in cities. Cindy's highest School is a 10, Tina's is a 4. So, Diana scores 3 x 8 = 24 points, Cindy score 2 x 8 = 16 points and Tina score 1 x 8 = 8 points.\n\nAnother difference in Granada is that the tiles are two-sided: on one side an even-numbered building of some type, on the other a different, odd-numbered building valued exactly one higher. The configuration of the buildings on both sides is identical in terms of moat placement or lack thereof on each side. When purchasing a building, a player can immediately place the building, as is, into her city or may flip it to the other side and place it in her supply for later placement during a remodel action.\n\nThe Building Market is initially filled with tiles even-side up. The next time the market is filled, the odd side will be placed up, then even, then odd, etc. A handy toggle feature is provided on the board near the Building Market to facilitate this.\n\nThe last difference between Alhambra and Granada, moats instead of walls, is really just a difference in artwork. As in Alhambra, during each scoring round, each player scores points for her longest continuous moat, instead of wall, surrounding her city. The rules are the same regarding tile placement: must be able to trace an unbroken path back to the city's center, moat can touch moat, etc. In games I've played, players have often commented that it seems to be harder to build with the moat tiles of Granada than with the wall tiles of Alhambra. Just one more way to make Granada an advanced version of Alhambra?\n\nRe-implements:\n\n    Alhambra", "['City Building', 'Puzzle'] ['Action Points', 'Hand Management', 'Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement'] Build the most harmonious futuristic city, in a tactical and interactive game.", "['Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Territory Building'] ['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Investment', 'Modular Board', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Manipulate and wager on the rise and fall of mortals as you shape a new world.", "['Racing', 'Sports'] ['Different Dice Movement', 'Push Your Luck', 'Roll \\\\/ Spin and Move'] Use custom dice to race on Formula 1 courses.", "['Environmental', 'Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Events', 'Open Drafting', 'Worker Placement'] Enhance your crew, claims & equipment to prosper in Alaskan gold mines before winter.", "['Deduction', 'Electronic', 'Exploration', 'Science Fiction'] ['Elapsed Real Time Ending', 'Events', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Set Collection'] Human scum, the clock is ticking!

The great Khan, king of the Huns, is suffering, and there are many who dream of taking his place. The Khan must appoint his successor. He will choose the bravest and most glorious of his generals, and you intend for that to be you! But you are not the only contender, and you will have to prove your worth.\n\nEach turn in Huns you must choose between raiding for resources or picking a card that will grant you a special ability. In more detail, the game includes five decks of cards in five colors that feature equipment, raids, mercenaries, curses, and treasure, as well as goods cubes in the same five colors. Each player starts the game with two wagons that require specific colored goods to fill them.\n\nAt the start of a round, the active player rolls five d3 dice in the five colors, then chooses one of the dice and takes either cubes or cards in this color. If you take cards, they draw 1-3 cards (based on the die roll), keep one of them, then place the others face down under this deck. Equipment gives you an in-game bonus, raids have a one-time effect, treasure earns you points at game's end if you meet the condition listed, mercenaries give you a reusable effect once you give them goods, and curses are played on opponents, who must apply goods to them to dispel their effect. If you take cubes, you can place them on a single mercenary card, a single curse card, or any number of your wagons in the appropriate spaces. If you fill a wagon, you draw a new one from those on display. Each player takes one die in turn, choosing cards or goods, until all the dice have been chosen. The first player marker then moves clockwise, and the new active player rolls all five dice again.\n\nWhen one of the cube colors or one of the decks is empty at the end of a round, the game ends. Players score points for raids undertaken, treasure achieved, mercenaries paid off, and wagons delivered, and whoever has the most points wins!

The Elves, Mages, Dwarves, Halflings and Humans lived peacefully with each other, though they increasingly engaged in fierce competition for the prosperity and glory of their respective nations.\n\nAnd so it was that when the divisiveness threatened to break the thousand-year peace, the Goblin Hordes from across the sea unleashed a devastating surprise attack, and the peoples of the Hiddenlands could not unify quickly enough to repel them. Remnants of each of the realms fled by ship, until they at last discovered a new, unoccupied land upon which they could begin building their civilizations anew. The old rivalries would remain, of course, but perhaps this time, their competition with each other would not welcome disaster. It was a time of hope, a time for exploration and construction, and a time of renewed competition in a new world they called Pandoria.\n\nIn the &quot;gamer's game&quot; 'Pandoria', players discover this new land by placing tiles, and they claim its territory and resources by placing their people. When a type of terrain is completely surrounded by other terrain, every worker on the borders of that terrain gains its resources. Although more than one civilization will usually benefit, each player tries to gain more than the others. Mining gold gives you income to buy cards that have two options: buildings and spells. Acquiring wood allows you to build that side of the card for permanent advantages, while mining crystals gives you the power to use the card for its one-time spell instead. Excess resources can be converted into prestige Points, and some buildings can generate more. When the new land has been fully explored (all tiles have been placed), the player with the most prestige is declared the most powerful nation of Pandoria and wins the game!\n\nThe game includes a streamlined beginner game, as well as expanded rules for the complete game that includes asymmetrical player powers.\n\nThe second edition from 2024 has the following changes: \n- The game board is double-sided\n- The 5 realms are newly designed\n- the cover is brighter/friendlier\n- the cards have a little different size\n- some realm characteristics are revised\n- the rule book has 4 pages more\n- the starting player tile is newly designed\nFind everything here: https://www.irongames.de/wordpress/index.php/the-games/pandoria-2024-2/\n\n&mdash;description from the designer", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', 'Real-time', 'Sports'] ['Team-Based Game'] A fast paced soccer game for 2 players or two teams of players.

Your opponents may also share some of the rats in your group; they may want to move the rats in a different manner from you.\n\nBefore play, each player gets secretly assigned three colors - these are their rats. \nPlayers roll colored dice (there is one for each rat and one neutral die) and the active player chooses one of them to move the corresponding rat forward (or backwards in case the die shows an anchor). Encircled numbers and symbols can be used for a rat of any color. The next player rolls the remaining dice (in case there was an x next to the number, the previously used die remains in the pool) and does the same. When there is only one die left, the ship sinks a number of fields according to a token drawn. If the water level reaches a rat, the rat and the corresponding die is taken out of the game. When a rat reaches a cheese token, the player who moved the rat gets the token. \nThe first rat to reach the top deck gets nothing; the second rat scores 5 points, the third one 3 points and the fourth one 2 points.

Each hero has variable melee, magic and speed scores, as well as a unique ability. Your second role in the game is as the malevolent &ldquo;Dungeonlord&rdquo;, trying to exterminate the other heroes.\n\nYou win the game when as a hero you complete 3 Quests such as destroying an evil laboratory or rescuing a princess.

This dungeon is created by the laying down of Map cards. You collect Glory and Peril as you move through the dungeon.  Glory buys cards that help your hero such as abilities and treasures, but your opponent spends your Peril against you to play monsters, traps and other unpleasant stuff.\n\nCombat is similar to Talisman.

Most of the fun comes from the theme, and surprising combination of events that occur.  Dungeoneer is likely to appeal to those who enjoy a classic dungeon crawl and RPG like action.\n\nVault of the Fiends features a few new mechanics that should serve to enhance the game play which players of Tomb of the Lich Lord will be familiar with.  Some monsters, and attack cards are &ldquo;pumpable&rdquo; that means you may spend extra Glory or Peril to boost the effectiveness of the card.  Also conditions on the map change such as effects being deactivated when a certain Quest is completed or throwing a switch in a room to extend a bridge across the Fiery Chasm.  One of the more unexpected new mechanics are &ldquo;artifact&rdquo; Quests, such as the Armor Golem&rsquo;s Glove which makes your hero more powerful or the Sunken Treasure which makes your hero faster.

The era of Space Race has just begun. Do you have what it takes to lead a daring space agency into a new age of human achievement?\n\nSpace Race takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.\n\nSpace Race is a card game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.\n\nThe game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.\n\nSpace Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Medieval', 'Territory Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Enclosure', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Simultaneous Action Selection'] The King is dead!

Fort Sumter is a small footprint game (11x17&rdquo; mounted map) that takes approximately 25-40 minutes to play. The game pits a Unionist versus a Secessionist player. Each player uses the area control mechanic pioneered in Mark Herman's We The People design and immortalized in Twilight Struggle to place, move, and remove political capital. The location of political capital determines who controls each of the four crisis dimensions (Political, Secession, Public Opinion, and Armaments). After three rounds of play, the game culminates in a Final Crisis confrontation to determine the winner.\n\nThe heart of the Fort Sumter design is Mark's CDG system where you use Strategy cards for their value or historic event to acquire political capital from the crisis track. Political capital tokens are used to compete for control of the twelve map spaces. Here the likes of William Lloyd Garrison, Sam Houston, Jefferson Davis, and Harriet Beecher Stowe walk on stage, while the Southern states dissolve the Union.\n\nThe twelve map spaces are grouped into the four dimensions of the crisis. You gain a victory point each round that you control a dimension&rsquo;s three spaces. For example, the Armaments dimension is characterized by Federal Arsenals, Fort Pickens, and of course, Fort Sumter. In addition, each round you score a victory point for controlling your secret objective space. But beware; either player can score active objective spaces. At the end of the dual Presidential inaugurations (round three) a new Final Crisis mechanic drives the game to its hotly contested conclusion.\n\nUtilizing a new Final Crisis Series mechanic, you may accelerate the crisis by breaching zones (escalation, tension, final crisis) that yield bonus political capital. However, beware, as the first person to breach the final crisis zone gains political advantage, yet loses victory point ground. Each game ends with a Final Crisis, where cards set-aside during the three rounds complete your final political maneuvers that determine the winner.", "['Card Game', 'Mature \\\\/ Adult', 'Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting'] Rush your manga military girls against Moscow to defeat the evil magician Stalin.", "['Ancient', 'City Building'] ['Action Drafting', 'Follow', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Turn Order'] Expand your cities, glorifying them with magnificent structures to vie for victory!", "['Card Game'] ['Open Drafting', 'Set Collection'] Players are trying to collect majorities in as many of the ten different commodities/glamorous chicken possessions as possible, by placing the most cards (or second most) of that card type out than anyone else.

Will you use the transit station to move another player&rsquo;s military base out of the way, or place your embassy to steal his temple? Will you try for a greater area under your control, or move to capture key buildings?\n\nInfinite City is a standalone tile game in which players become the leaders of corporations building an ever-sprawling city, maneuvering to control the largest districts while holding on to the most valuable buildings.\n\nInfinite City uses tiles to represent buildings, and colored pegs to represent control by players.  The tiles are mixed, five tiles are dealt to each player, and five tiles are placed face down in the shape of a cross at the center of the play area.  On their turns, players play a tile face up adjacent to one of the five starting tiles or a previously played tile, play one of their colored pegs on the tile, and follow the instructions on the tile.  These instructions may lead to playing additional tiles, drawing tiles, moving tiles previously played, turning face down tiles face up, taking tiles from opponents, preventing actions or even exchanging hands of tiles with other players.  When players finish their turns, if they have less than five tiles in their hands, they draw additional tiles so that they end their turn with at least five tiles.\n\nThe game ends when one player places the last of his colored pegs, or the fifth Power Station tile is played.  Each player is awarded points for contiguous groups of at least three tiles controlled by him at a rate of one point per tile.

On each turn, you play three cards from your hand to move your ships. Your cards have a basic movement number, and often a secondary action. You may use one or the other to move your ships down the track or gain special advantages.\n\nEach of the three tracks winds through the Caribbean islands toward your ultimate goal: the Spanish Treasure Galleon at Trinidad. Along the way, there will be detours that lead to merchant ships that may be plundered, and towns that may be visited to cash in your plunder for treasure. Plundering merchant ships and visiting towns also allows you to recruit more crewmen (cards) for your crew (deck). The better your deck is, the faster that your ships are able to move, so deciding when to take detours for plunder and recruiting and when to sail on toward your ultimate goal is an important decision that every pirate captain must make.\n\nThe first pirate captain to reach the Treasure Galleon at the end of any track ends the game.

He named it Graenaland, a green land. Four years later the first colonists arrived to Greanaland and founded settlements that lasted more than four centuries.\n\nTake the role of one of the jarls leading their clans to the new home. You have to settle the coast and to agree with your neighbors on how to distribute the spare resources the land is giving away. As Eric wants no fights amongst Vikings, any conflicts are solving by voting. You could improve your position in order to gain more votes; however, you can also try to be righteous and to keep good relations with all your neighbors. Cooperating with them, you can fertilize and improve the land easier than when struggling for influence; just keep your position strong enough for the case something goes wrong.\n\nAt first glance, it might remind you just another settler-like game &ndash; there are tiles of different terrains, there are villages and other buildings built on the tiles, and there are resources produced to build more of them. However, Graenaland uses these elements by very unusual way, and offers brand new player interaction.\n\nThe main difference is that villages produce no resources; the tile produces them. They remain placed next to the tile, until players agree how to distribute them. Every village on the tile gives one vote to its owner, as well as the traveling heroes just visiting the tile &ndash; and you need more than half of the votes total for your proposal how to distribute the resources.\n\nA tile produces only one resource per turn, no matter how many villages of how many players is built on it. Building more villages on the same tile strengthens your position here; however, if another player does the same, you both are spending lots of efforts and resources struggling for still the one resource card. May be it would be wise to live in peace instead. If you are able to come to an agreement, you can take turns taking the resource. You can vote together in the case an intruder appears. You can build some improvements on the tile together, increasing its resource production. You can spread your villages to other tiles and let your hero travel where it is more needed, rather than struggling for influence on this tile.\n\nIf you trust each other, you can work much more efficiently. However: does your neighbor deserve your trust? What if he returns with his hero unexpectedly, and confiscates the whole harvest of several turns? What if he builds another village here instead of the improvement he promised? And especially &ndash; what would you do if you get such an opportunity yourself? \nThe game mechanics &ndash; simultaneous movement of heroes, small anomalies in player roles (one player has special role every turn), and decent randomness and uncertainty in resource harvesting (each terrain produces resources of more types, with different probabilities) lead to enough interesting asymmetric situations, and it is up to you whether you take any advantage you have, or whether you try to appear fair and righteous to the others instead.

Birds that can deal out a massive amount of destruction on the battlefield, and look sexy doing it. At least as sexy as a cardboard chit can look.

War never goes as planned and great leaders must deal with adversity when it happens. So we thought, 'Let's shake things up a bit&quot;. In games with this option, if you draw the &quot;battlefield chaos&quot; counter, a roll is made to see what the gods of war have hefted upon you, your enemy, or both of you. Anything from bad weather, extra support missions, shell-shocked troops, or skillful battle plans, can come your way.\n\nThe war is raging on and now it is up to the British and their formidable array of weapons systems to blunt the Soviet spearhead. Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong with top-of-the-line Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridge layers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft and many more.

At that point, incomplete towers will also earn points. Thus, players who have meeples allocated on any of the towers (regardless of whether they are external or central) receive the following score:\n1st place in arcane influence: 3 points of prestige;\n2nd place in arcane influence: 2 points of prestige;\nDraw in arcane influence: 1 point of prestige.\n\nIn addition, each meeple in the players magic book will also yield 1 prestige point.

You have only three pawns, so plan well for these talks!\n\nPlayers draw cards each round: character cards that can bring new lords into play and event cards such as good harvests, good weather and taxes. They pay the costs to play cards, with some cards being playable at any time to upset current events with a surprise assassination or underground invasion. Players then receive income, with which they can buy troops and buildings, and move lords and troops among villages, with troops never being able to travel without a lord. If troops from more than one player end up in the same village, they battle until one side is eliminated or forced to flee.\n\nIf a player controls all villages in a fief and has at least one castle there, he can purchase the title of the fief and assign it to a lord, with the title being passed to an heir if the lord subsequently dies. Players also try to secure the titles of king and pope, which provide benefits of their own, as well as points.

The float and march south from Canada had almost a surreal quality juxtaposed against the Adirondack wilderness. Hundreds of vessels making up an immense inland navy on Lake Champlain transported nearly 9,000 combatants together with 138 cannon. Burgoyne's objective was Fort Ticonderoga and from there, Albany, and a rendezvous with British forces coming from New York City. The strategic purpose of the campaign was nothing short of an end to the American Rebellion.\n\nThe intrigue on the American side lay in the cult of personality. Saratoga was to be Benedict Arnold's greatest victory in a string of successes which rank him among the finest field commanders of the era. Known to all Americans as the great traitor, it is ironic to discover that twice he salvaged the Revolution from certain collapse. It was Arnold's conspicuous gallantry and bold leadership which assured America victory at Saratoga and, by extension, its independence.\n\nThe fighting at Freeman's Farm would be savage. Here no farmer's militia, but rather Continental Regulars (anxious to redeem a recent reputation for retreat), stood toe to toe with Europe's finest. The sanguinary nature of the fighting was summed up best by American Brigadier General John Glover who said, &quot;Both sides seemed determined to conquer or die.&quot;\n\nIt's the 19th of September, 1777. Do you, as the British, attempt to storm the prepared American positions on the high ground at Bemis Heights in order to open up the River Road and the most direct route to Albany? Or do you attempt to turn the American left where intelligence reports the American defenses are incomplete and the ground favors your approach? How will you employ the large number of Hessian mercenaries in your army? Will their performance match their reputation?\n\nAs the Americans do you wait on Bemis Heights for the approach of the enemy as General Gates preferred, or do you sortie and meet the approach of the British in the forests where their artillery will be of little value? Will Generals Gates and Arnold cooperate, or will their feud spell disaster for the American cause? And what of the fog on this chilly Autumn morning? Will it be an ally to the Americans by impeding the progress of the enemy?\n\nThese are only a few of the challenges facing you as you relive one of history's most decisive battles and the turning point of the American Revolution.", "['Puzzle'] ['Action Drafting', 'Grid Coverage', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building'] A game of collecting and connecting memories--how they weave together is everything!", "[\"Children's Game\", 'Puzzle'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Set Collection'] Draw from a bag to decorate your bedroom, but watch out for the monsters!", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling'] Exciting area-impulse treatment of the WWII battle at Monte Casino.", "['Civilization', 'Medieval', 'Renaissance'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling'] Improve your fortunes through the rise, apogee, and fall of the Venetian Republic.", "['Card Game'] ['Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Variable Set-up'] Explore all new power combinations in this tactical card game.", "['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Travel'] ['Hand Management', 'Income', 'Investment', 'Open Drafting', 'Point to Point Movement'] Elves coming of age travel the kingdom.", "['Prehistoric'] ['Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Take That', 'Tile Placement'] Raise your tribe by gathering resources and finding shelter in this domino puzzle.", "['Animals', 'Farming'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Take That', 'Worker Placement'] Silk worm shepherds raise & graze their worms and keep them away from the predator.", "['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Fantasy'] ['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Layering', 'Pattern Building'] Regroup your Chicken Warriors and Chicken Wizards to fight for the glory!", "['Age of Reason'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Set Collection', 'Worker Placement'] Fuel the French revolution by increasing your influence in key places.", "['Dice'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil'] Roll and write game of getting as close as possible to the target.", "['Card Game', 'Puzzle', 'Real-time'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Real-Time'] Will you find the treasure before the time runs out?", "['Party Game', 'Trivia'] [] Earn your smarty pants by listing items that fit the category.", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Action Queue', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] World War 2 in Europe.", "['Economic', 'Science Fiction', 'Trains', 'Transportation'] ['Crayon Rail System', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Network and Route Building', 'Pick-up and Deliver'] Draw your railroad on the moon to connect supply to demand and make huge payoffs.", "['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'King of the Hill', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Secret Unit Deployment', 'Variable Player Powers'] Starcraft-like RTS at your table.", "['Transportation', 'Travel'] ['Hand Management', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement'] Take passengers to visit some of Lisbon's most beautiful monuments.", "['Economic', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology', 'Travel'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Tech Trees \\\\/ Tech Tracks', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up'] Secure mortal belief to lead the Eldranic pantheon into a new age.", "['Civilization', 'Negotiation'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Network and Route Building', 'Trading'] Gather your resources and build settlements in the fertile Nile Valley!", "['Economic', 'Environmental', 'Science Fiction'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Commodity Speculation', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Map Addition'] Squeeze every last drop of profit out of the planet before it self-destructs.", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', \"Children's Game\", 'Real-time'] ['Pattern Building'] Stack cups as fast as you can to match the picture!", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', 'Animals', \"Children's Game\"] ['Stacking and Balancing'] Stack animals on a bridge without toppling them to achieve secret missions!", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Print & Play'] ['Layering', 'Pattern Building', 'Take That', 'Tile Placement'] Lay tiles to combine hot spices, but cover up the rats or you lose straight away.", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', 'Dice'] ['Flicking'] Jam dice down the hole and wrestle them off the board in this battle of two halves.", "['Adventure', 'Exploration', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting'] ['Area Movement', 'Critical Hits and Failures', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Grid Movement', 'Role Playing'] Go exploring for treasure in this dungeon crawl board game.", "['Card Game', 'Educational', 'Memory', 'Party Game', 'Puzzle'] ['Memory', 'Pattern Recognition'] Compete with others in the quick brain challenging tasks.", "['Animals', 'Dice'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Push Your Luck', 'Roll \\\\/ Spin and Move'] In Die Heisse Schlacht am Kalten Buffet, alternatively released as Kangaroo and Generalowsky, players try to win prize cards from the limited number available to them &mdash;

The game consists of player cards and team defensive cards that accurately reproduce play outcomes and player, team, and league statistics of the National Football League for the season on which the cards are based.  Play progresses with the gamer on offense calling his play (run or pass, where the play is directed, the ball carrier or primary receiver, etc.) and the gamer on defense setting a defensive configuration (blitzes, double coverage of receivers, stacking the line, etc.).  In the cards and dice version, three dice are then rolled, with one die determining whether the play result comes from the offensive or defensive cards and the other two determining the result from the speciifed card.  Play takes place on a game board that resembles a football field, and the gamers keep track of the ball position, the down, and the time remaining in the quarter being played.  Penalties and injuries are part of the game.  Gamers play from the perspective of a head coach and/or general manager.\n\nThe game also comes in a computer version that automatically determines play outcomes and compiles and reports player, team and league statistics.  The computer version grapically portrays the plays using X's and O's to depict player movement.

The landscape bristles with three divine energies. Every player action alters the balance of power among those energies, and thus the players collectively determine Lagoon&rsquo;s destiny. One divine energy shall inherit Lagoon, and the player who best served it wins!\n\nThe world is built using hexagonal tiles, and a new tile is drawn from a bag each time a druid explores a site. Site tiles are double-sided, and each side represents a different mystical site offering a unique magical power to the druids. Each site is also enchanted with one of three divine energies: Elemeen, Vowelon and Deonin. Since the two sides of a site tile are always linked to different energies, every site explored presents a choice of which energy to advance over the other two, as well as what magic will be put into the world for use by the druids. Players also strategically deploy their druids to unravel sites aligned with an energy they choose to oppose, removing such sites from the world and tipping the balance of power towards the other two energies.\n\nThe energy with the most sites in play at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny, and the player who most supported that dominant energy is the winner. Support is tracked in two ways. First, whenever exploring a site and expanding an energy's reach in Lagoon, the exploring player gains a divine seed token matching the explored site's energy. These seeds can be spent in various ways over the course of the game, but any seeds of the dominant energy remaining in a player's supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it is removed from play and placed in front of that player.

As the game begins, the defense of Vitebsk, a Byelorussian fortified city located just a few hexes beyond the southeast corner of the playing surface, has just collapsed. 1st Baltic Front is advancing westward through the shredded German line, and will soon threaten all of Army Group North with encirclement. Finally, after four months of fierce battle, the Red Army will win the great prize of this campaign, Riga, and pocket the enemy in the Courland region of Latvia.\n\nBaltic Gap allows players to explore this interesting campaign from a variety of historical and hypothetical vantage points. Long campaign games can be enjoyed by up to five players. Several short scenarios are also provided, and these work best with a single player per side.\n\nBaltic Gap is the 11th wargame in the award winning Operational Combat System (&ldquo;OCS&rdquo;). It stays true to the ground breaking earlier games in the system that allow players a deeper glimpse into why the skills and behaviors of the two sides were so very different.

Each game turn is broken down into three phases:\nPhase 1: Welcoming the Princes\nPhase 2: Development of the City\nPhase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points\n\nPhase 1: Welcoming the Princes\n\nIn the first phase, Guest tokens are placed on the board near ship icons but corresponding to the symbol on each token. These guest tokens are then replaced with Prince tokens that is their own color, or of the same civilization as the chosen Guest or in any District of the island indicated by the Guest or any combination of these. This is repeated three times until all Guest tokens have been removed from the board. While this is happening, players may Build a Wonder or Take Control of a District.\n\nAt any point during their turn, if a player has one prince of each of the 5 civilizations on one island (regardless of which Districts they are in), he may immediately construct a Wonder and receives 6 Prestige Points. There may only be one Wonder per island and a player does not have to construct Wonders.\n\nAt any point during their turn, if a player possesses 3 princes of the same civilization in the same District, and that District is not already controlled by another player, he may decide to take control of the District by placing a Monument on that District. There can only be one Monument per District, and this space, once acquired, cannot be retaken. For taking control of a District the player gains Prestige Points during Phase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points. Also, if the District belongs to an island where a Wonder has been constructed, the owner of the Wonder immediately scores the number of Prestige Points indicated on the District.\n\nPhase 2: Development of the City\n\nEach player receives 5 Action cards and discards based on their score in the score track. The person in the lead discards two cards, the last player doesn't discard any and all other players discard one. Four types of actions are possible and occur multiple times in a player's turn:\n\n1) Move one or two princes:\n\nIf a player decides to move two princes with a single action card, these two princes must be within the same District and make the same movement.\n\nLAND MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization to an adjacent District (Districts are separated by alleys or bridges).\n\nSEA MOVEMENT: By discarding an action card, a player may move one or two princes of that civilization from one maritime District (showing a ship) to another maritime District. These two Districts must be in the same maritime sector or in two adjacent maritime sectors. (The division of the maritime sectors is indicated by the dotted lines originating from the 3 lighthouses of the city).\n\n2) Add a prince:\n\nBy discarding an Action Card, a player may place a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization.\n\n3) Remove a Prince:\n\nIf the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. Th e player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.\n\nor 4) Influence the King (altering the Prestige Scale):\n\nIf the player possesses a prince in a District occupied by a Monument of that civilization, regardless of the player who controls the District, that player may, with an Action Card of that civilization, remove the Prince from the board. For this action the player immediately gains 2 Prestige Points. The player&rsquo;s Minister figure is moved up two places on the Score Track.\n\nThe value of each civilization, indicated on the Prestige Scale, determines the point value of the districts controlled by each player at the end of the turn. By discarding an Action Card, a player may increase the value of a civilization by 1. The Value figure of the civilization changes places with the figure directly above it. With two Action cards, a player may reduce the value of a civilization to 1. All the other figures are moved up accordingly. At the end of their turn a player can only have a maximum of 5 Action Cards.\n\nPhase 3: Calculation of Prestige Points\n\nOnce all the players have carried out their actions, the points for the round are calculated. Each player, in turn order, gains points for each District that they control. The value of each civilization is indicated on the Prestige Scale. The players&rsquo; Minister figures are moved up the Score Track.\n\nIf one or more players have reached at least 50 Prestige Points at the end of this phase, the game ends.

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.\n\nCarthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).\n\nCarthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.\nCarthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby.

Members of the different lemming mafia families aren't any different. Because in the game, there is not only one, but six members of the suicidal species, they make a contest out of it. They all run to the lake and the first one who jumps in the lake wins. And it wouldn't be a real race if you couldn't place bets on the result. Each player has his favorite lemmings and tries to use the dice results to influence the race.&quot;\n\nGame Summary\nEach player has 6 cards (1/lemming), and 2 mission cards (bonus VP at end of game). On your turn, roll two dice (sides show one of the lemming colors) then choose to move one of those lemmings (if one is out of the race, move the lemming in last place). Lemmings may move one track section at a time, to any unoccupied space in the next section. The spaces on the race track are one of several types (e.g., give a lemming concrete shoe; 2=dead, remove concrete, allow you to place bets, move a lemming, etc.).\n\nBetting is interesting: each time, you have the option to bet. To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed).\n\nThe game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).", "['Card Game', 'Exploration'] ['Action \\\\/ Event', 'Cooperative Game', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Storytelling'] Journey with Vikings in the footsteps of Erik the Red.", "['City Building', 'Puzzle'] ['End Game Bonuses', 'Grid Coverage', 'Highest-Lowest Scoring', 'Square Grid'] Puzzle a harmonious city worthy of the queen to collect the most points.", "['American Civil War', 'Civil War', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame'] ['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Line of Sight', 'Movement Points'] Death Valley: Battles for the Shenandoah is the seventh installment of the Great Battles of the American Civil War (GBACW) series, published by GMT Games.\n\nDeath Valley: Battles for the Shenandoah contains eight battle games with multiple scenarios. They range from division level contests on half sized maps to two map battles between armies. Experienced players will be able to play many of the scenarios in one sitting. The rules compare the development of the cavalry, and the changes in infantry and artillery organization and tactics in 1862 and 1864.\n\nThree Battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862\nIn a campaign still studied in military academies, Confederate General Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson engaged and defeated the Union forces pursuing him.

Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes-chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.\n\nChanges have been made to the series rules for Death Valley in order to enhance their clarity and simulation value.

Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.\n\nHoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat.

Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu&eacute;s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves.

In this volume the Swedish face the tough Polish cavalry, lance equipped winged Husars and Cossacks. The Swedish-style brigades also take on the unbeaten Tilly at the head of the allied Catholic League and Imperial armies. Finally, Wallenstein, with a resurgent Imperial army, mastered the art of drawing out the Swedes to attack on ground of his choosing.\n\nIn each battle included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms, armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player who can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions or brigades, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, Cavalry Pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The battles included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms are:\n\nDirschau 1627 - The Prussian campaign that started in 1626, Gustav Adolf had finally brought the Poles to the field and defeated them in battle at Gniew a month before, skillfully using terrain to offset the powerful Polish Hussars.

King Gustav Adolf's final battle.\n\nHonigfelde / Trzciano 1629 - &quot;I've never had a hotter bath!&quot; exclaimed Gustav II Adolf upon his return. Very nearly captured while trying to extricate his army from a Polish and Imperial trap, this great cavalry battle showed the Poles were to be treated with respect. Rheingraf Otto Ludwig's German cavalry attacked the advancing Poles and was drawn into a pincer. Gustav Adolf rushed forward to save the impetuous Rheingraf. Koniecpolski showed his cunning. The Imperial contingent joined the fray and sent the Swedes falling back.

In the period covered, the armies deployed in more compact formations so each battle fits on half of a standard map.\n\nThe battles covered in this game are:\n\nWhite Mountain\nNovember, 1620\nThe combined army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, the Count of Tilly, strike a blow directly at the Bohemian capital of Prague. The Bohemians make a stand on the slopes of White Mountain outside the town. Their Transylvanian allies desert them at the most critical point of the battle, causing the total collapse of the Bohemian army and its cause.\n\nThis is a short scenario where the qualitatively superior Catholic forces must crush the strongly positioned Bohemians who are bolstered by a large Transylvanian contingent of questionable reliability.\n\nWimpfen\nMay, 1622\nTilly joins forces with the Spanish under Cordoba. Together they pursue the smaller army of the Markgraf of Baden-Durlach. They catch his army near the town of Wimpfen, where it is drawn up in a defensive position in a river bend. The Badian camp is fortified in a special traditional way with Spie&szlig;wagen (&quot;pikewagons&quot;), mobile barricades equipped with sharp poles and small mortars. Only when a powder wagon detonates in the midst of the Protestant position, scattering the defenders, the Catholics are able to storm the wagonburg and heavy fighting breaks out.\n\nA balanced pitched battle. A larger Catholic army tries to defeat a Protestant army that is not only protected by a wagonburg but also possesses a strong cavalry force for counterattacks.\n\nH&ouml;chst\nJune, 1622\nThe Bavarians under Tilly catch the forces of the zealous Protestant Duke Christian as they try to cross the river Main. To protect the crossing, Christian makes a stand at a stream. At first Tilly hesitates, but eventually the Bavarians attack and the Protestant army dissolves in a chaotic retreat.\n\nA rearguard situation, where the Protestants must delay the Catholics while simultaneously trying to retreat the majority of their army to safety.\n\nFleurus\nAugust, 1622\nDefeated and demoralized, the combined forces of the condottiere Mansfeld and Duke Christian try to escape the German theater and enter the service of the United Provinces instead. Cordoba's Spanish army blocks them at Fleurus in what is today Belgium. The unpaid and mutinous Protestants attack at dawn in an attempt to break through. In a vicious five-hour fight, the Spanish hold, but enough Protestants break through to force the Spanish to lift an important siege in the Netherlands.\n\nThis is a smaller pitched battle where a large but very unreliable Protestant army attempts to overwhelm the smaller but more experienced Spanish army. This battle is suitable as an introduction to the game system.\n\nStadtlohn\nAugust, 1623\nFollowing the battle of Fleurus, Duke Christian again rebuilds an army with raw recruits to join with Mansfeld in the Netherlands and renew the fight for the Protestant cause. However, he soon finds himself outlawed by the Imperor, unsupported and forced to retreat when Tilly's veteran army bears down on him. The Protestan army, slowed by a massive baggage train attempts a last stand and finds itself caught by Tilly's vanguard when within sight of the Dutch border. True to form, Christian decides to risk his army to save his baggage train, but ends up losing both.\n\nA race-against-the-clock rearguard situation where the focus is on the fate of the Protestant baggage train that is slowly moving towards the map edge.\n\nLutter am Barenberge\nAugust, 1626\nThe Danish King Christian IV intervenes in the Thirty Years War and pushes Tilly back during the early summer. However, he finds himself outnumbered and on the defensive when Tilly is reinforced by Imperial troops. Christian decides to turn on his pursuers and gives battle in a strong defensive position at Lutter am Barenberge. The initial Catholic attacks are repulsed, but the subsequent uncontrolled Danish counterattack results in the eventual collapse of the Danish army.\n\nThis is also a rearguard battle, but with more evenly matched armies, though the Danes are severely hampered by an unusual command situation.\n\nIn addition to scenario specific special rules that highlight the unique events of each battle, the battles in the game all share a simple set of special rules. These rules show the peculiarities of the early years of the Thirty Years War, such as Croat/Transylvanian style light cavalry.\n\nEven though not all of the battles included were equal contests in military terms, the player victory conditions are balanced. Along with the special rules, that means the battles are interesting for both sides.", "['Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Medieval', 'Mythology', 'Territory Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Turn Order', 'Worker Placement'] Harness the dark power of alchemy.

The King has named the feudal lords who will bring glory and prosperity to the conquered lands.

Players earn points by building, either developing their own feuds or helping in the different phases of the construction of the cathedral.  During a turn, each player plays their vassals from their hand to gather money and resources, to further invest in new workers or new buildings.

It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.\n\nThe battles included in this game are:\n\nEdgehill, 23 October 1642\n    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.\n\nFirst Newbury, 20 September 1643\n    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.\n\nMarston Moor, 2 July 1644\n    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.\n\nSecond Newbury, 27 October 1644\n    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.\n\nNaseby, 14 June 1645\n    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.\n\n2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters.

You are sitting in a bar in a fantasy world, playing cards for gold. The setting is a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons style bar and the game may be played as a sub-plot of a D&amp;D game if desired.\n\nGoal\nThe goal is to have the most gold at the point where the first player runs out of gold. In a two player game, you just have to bankrupt your opponent, but in a larger game, you may have to prop up another player until you become the richest.\n\nGameplay\nA game is played over a series of hands until the end-condition is reached (above). A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.\n\nThe game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.\n\nThis game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.\n\nFrom WoTC site:\nThis fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents!

It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.\n\nFire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.\nThere are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.\n\nThe rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.\n\nFire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.\n\nGame Components:\n\n    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)\n    over 2880 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)\n    a complete set of rules\n    a complete set of charts\n    two dice\n\n\n(source: back of the box and user's description)", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] The world's mightiest superpowers clash in this epic and intense WWII board game.", "['Pike and Shot', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points', 'Simulation'] Nothing Gained But Glory will be the fifth volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series. It features several pivotal battles in Baltic region of the late 17th century - a period where rulers struggled to centralize power in their realms and to introduce permanent standing armies instead of expensive mercenary forces. It shows the highly trained and well led army of Sweden struggling to defend its massive gains from the Thirty Years War and the Northern Wars of 1655-1661 against the forces of Denmark and Brandenburg, reinforced by contingents from Austria, the United Provinces, M&uuml;nster, Hesse-Kassel and Poland.\n\nThe personalities in the game include the great Swedish warrior king Carl XI, Brandenburg&acute;s Frederick William (the Great Elector), and King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. Never before have so many monarchs been in one M&amp;P box!\n\nNearly all the scenarios in this module are smaller than the typical Musket &amp; Pike scenarios, and thus take less time and space to play. For the same reasons it is a great introductory game to the series.\n\nThe Historical Background\n\nThe Scanian War was prompted by the Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries, and was eventually forced to fulfill her treaty obligations to France by invading Brandenburg. This invasion was an attempt to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the fighting against France, but the invasion was conducted without the usual energy and force of previous Swedish offensives. When the Brandenburg Army returned home much faster than anticipated the Swedes started to withdraw, but were caught by the Brandenburgers and defeated at the battle of Fehrbellin on June 28th 1675. The previously &quot;unbeatable&quot; Swedish Army had lost a battle, and this key event soon persuaded others to join the war.\n\nMost notable of these was Denmark, which saw its chance to regain the Scanian lands lost in the Northern Wars. (Scania is the southern tip of Sweden, just across the Oeresund, the Sound, from Denmark.) After mopping up the Swedish possessions of Wismar and Bremen, the Danish Army landed in Scania on June 29, 1676. Danish King Christian V led 15,000 troops against a defending Swedish Army of 5,000 men that were spread out over the province. Initially the operation was a great success. Large parts of the local peasantry sided with Denmark and the outnumbered Swedish troops were in bad shape. Town after town fell into the hands of the Danes and the Swedes had to retreat north to Sweden proper. After a month only the fortified town of Malm&ouml; remained under Swedish control. At sea the situation wasn&acute;t any better for the Swedes, as their navy lost several battles against the combined Danish- Dutch Navy, and left the command of the sea in the hands of the allies.\n\nTwo factors helped to save Sweden from ruin: the splendid courage of their young king who resolutely and successfully kept the Danish invaders at bay, and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, the French king.\n\nThe first ray of light for the Swedish cause came with the battle of Halmstad in August 1675 when the king succeeded in outmaneuvering and destroying a small Danish force sent north to take Halmstad and link up with the forces operating out from Norway. As the Swedish Army slowly grew larger it became possible to meet the Danish main army head on, and the Swedes were victorious at the battles of Lund in December 1676 and Landskrona in June 1677. These battles caused the fighting to stalemate on the Scanian front, as the Danish could supply and reinforce their coastal fortresses by sea, but didn&acute;t dare venture inland to meet the Swedish Army in a field battle again.\n\nThe focus of the war therefore shifted to the German front once again, where the Brandenburg Army was slowly conquering the Swedish fortresses and fortified cities one by one. The Danish Army sent an expeditionary force to the island of R&uuml;gen and captured it, but lost it again in January 1678 after a winter of horrid attrition, when the Swedes returned to the island once more and defeated them in the battle of Warksow. Later in 1678 the Allies would take R&uuml;gen once more, and eventually all the Swedish possessions in Germany were lost.\n\nEvents in Western Europe would once again have far reaching effects on the Baltic as the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 gave France the power to force an end to the Scanian War and dictate the peace treaties of Fontainebleau. These treaties restored almost all the Swedish possessions lost during the war, and so the end result was truly &ldquo;Nothing Gained but Glory.&rdquo;\n\nThe 7 battles included in Nothing Gained but Glory are:\n\nNyborg, November 14, 1659 - (While not part of the Scanian War, this bonus battle from the Northern War of 1655-1660 features many of the same participants.) The Swedes had occupied the Danish island of F&uuml;nen, but following the landings of two Allied forces and their subsequent combination the Swedes had to fight to win time for an evacuation from the island. With no more room to retreat and the port town of Nyborg&acute;s fortifications in a sorry state, the 7,000 strong Swedish Army positioned itself in good defensive terrain between a lake and a forest. While command difficulties in the 11,000 strong Allied Army almost cost them the battle, the Allies eventually prevailed, forcing the Swedish Army to flee to Nyborg, where it surrendered the next day.\n\nFehrbellin, June 28, 1675 - Returning from fighting against France to face the Swedish invasion, the highly mobile Brandenburg Army of 5,600 cavalry and 13 guns faced a retreating Swedish Army of 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 7 guns outside the town of Fehrbellin. A poor deployment of the Swedish Army combined with aggressive handling of the Brandenburg cavalry forced the Swedes from the field. Although the losses in the battle were about equal, the Swedish Army was severely reduced by the subsequent pursuit, raiding peasant guerilla, desertion, and starvation. While only of minor importance militarily, the victory had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered &quot;unbeatable&quot;, had been bested. With the myth of Swedish invincibility broken, Denmark decided the time was right to settle its scores with Sweden and entered the war. Frederick William henceforth was known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory became the core of the future famous Prussian Army.\n\nHalmstad, August 17, 1676 - After the initial great successes for the Danish forces following the landings in Scania in late June 1676, a small Danish force of 3,500 men under Jacob Duncan was detached from the main army and ordered to advance north to take the town of Halmstad and if possible link up with the Norwegian forces under General Gyldenl&oslash;ve. Sensing the possibility of destroying the unsupported Danish detachment, the Swedish king reacted and by heavy force marching succeeded in cutting off Duncan from his line of communications, forcing him to fight his way back. Duncan moved against the Swedes, but then went on the defensive. The Swedes took the initiative, collapsed both of the Danish flanks, and then overwhelmed the center, forcing the army to surrender. This battle ended the Danish plans of linking up with the Norwegians, and provided a much-needed boost to Swedish morale.\n\nLund, December 4, 1676 - This was the bloodiest battle in the history of Scandinavia, with almost 9,000 killed (out of 12,000 Danes and 8,000 Swedes) after an intense day-long battle fought in the chilling cold of the Scandinavian winter. After a cross-river standoff that lasted for a month, the Swedes attacked when the river froze. The Swedes initially had the advantage, and their right wing (along with the king) routed the Danish left and pursued it off the field. The rest of the Swedish Army was then outnumbered, and just as they were about to succumb, the king and part of his wing showed up in the Danish rear, saving the battle for the Swedes.\n\nMalm&ouml;, June 25-26, 1677 - Malm&ouml;, the regional capital of Scania, was the only major town that didn&acute;t fall during the 1676 Danish offensive, and had been a thorn in the Danish side ever since. In June 1677 the Danes decided to take the town by besieging it.\nWhen news arrived that the Swedish Navy had set sail to break the blockade of the town and that the Swedish Army was moving to relieve the town, the Danes decided to force the issue and storm the town, even though the siege hadn&acute;t progressed very far. On the Swedish side, the town commander Fabian Fersen prepared his 2,300 strong garrison well, and they fought with desperate courage as they knew it was victory or death. While the Danes were able to scale the wall and break into the city, a determined Swedish counterattack destroyed them before they could open the gates for more Danish troops.\n(This is a medium sized battle on a half map with various special rules to reflect the many special circumstances of storming a fortified town at night.)\n\nLandskrona, July 14, 1677 - After the defeat of the Danish Army at Malm&ouml;, the Swedish king decided the time was right to attack them before they could be reinforced by their German and Austrian allies. He thus moved his 10,000 regulars and 4,000 peasant militia towards the Danish Army located at Landskrona. However, the Danes had received their reinforcements that replenished their numbers to 14,000, and the Danish king felt confident about fighting a field battle. This was a hard-fought battle which saw both armies experimenting with combined arms wings and the personal involvement of the monarchs of both armies.\n\nWarksow, January 18, 1678 - As the war had reached a stalemate on the Scanian front the Danish forces invaded the island of R&uuml;gen in the fall of 1677. They quickly conquered most of the island except for a small Swedish fortified bridgehead. As supplies ran low and attrition ravaged the army, large parts of the Danish expedition were withdrawn from the island, leaving just under 5,000 men. This allowed the Swedes to transfer 3,500 men from their field army in Germany to the remaining bridgehead in early January 1678 and try to take back the island. The armies met at Warksow, where a Swedish cannonade killed the commander of the Danish Army, paralyzing it. Most of the Danish expeditionary force was captured during the battle or in the aftermath as the Swedes quickly cleared R&uuml;gen.\n\nComponents:\n1 series rulebook\n1 playbook\n3 countersheets\n2 2.5 map sheets, 2 of which are backprinted\n1 10-sided die\n3 Player Aid Cards", "['Card Game', 'Comic Book \\\\/ Strip', 'Mythology', 'Video Game Theme'] ['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Delayed Purchase', 'Hand Management', 'Take That', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Variable Set-up'] Athena is threatened by the great Pope, and the Knights subjected to his power are ready to fight!\n\n5 Bronze Knights: Seiya, ShiryÅ«, HyÅga, Shun, and Ikki must end this threat before the extinction of the last flame of the Clock.\n\nDuring the game, players each play one of the five available Heroes.

The ambitious Caesar, a military ingenue, had little idea of how lucky he was going to be -- as he was in usually everything he did -- because, within a short space of a few years, after coming to the rescue of the Gauls against incursions from Germanic tribes to the east, Caesar himself decided to bring the rest of the barbarian tribes under the domain of Republican Rome...and, at the same time, increase his visibility among the Roman people.\nFrom a military point of view it was an immense achievement, one that fueled Roman imperialist feelings like no other war. For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.\n\nBibracte 58BC     \nCaesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.\n\nThe Rhine 58BC     \nHaving defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.\n\nThe Sabis 57BC     \nHaving decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.\n\nBay of Biscay 56BC     \nThe sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.\n\nBritannia 55BC     \nLate Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.\n\nLutetia 52BC     \nThere are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.\n\nGame Features:\n\n        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.\n        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.\n        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.\n        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.\n        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.\n        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.\n        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.\n        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.\n\n\nTIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn\nMAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex\nUNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four\n\n(source: GMT website)\n\n\nExpansion Modules:\n\n     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia\n     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE\n     Battles of the Warrior Queen: Covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero.

Have you enjoyed a good historical novel dated on the old Republic of Rome, and you would like to travel to that time?\n\nONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is a war game similar to miniatures games in which both sides fight an ancient battle. The game is mainly based on the II Punic war, although battles from III to I B.C centuries can be also simulated. The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling. ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).\n\nUnits are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.  Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.\n\nLeadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!\n\nONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:\n\n1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.\n2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.\n3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.\n4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.\n5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.\n6.

Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port.

Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).\n\nEach round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track.

(This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)\n    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.\n    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.\n    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. \n    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.\n    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.\n\n\nAfter six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color.

And the battles fought for this prize are a record of the changing face of how war was fought.\n\nAt the start of the 'war', the main forces were mounted men-at-arms and a tightly packed and closed formation of pike, especially as represented by the Swiss. But as battle churned into battle, that slowly changed. Firepower, in the form of the arquebus (an early musket) became increasingly prevalent and dominant, forcing the closed pike formations to open up, as the Spanish did (with sword and buckler), and the reliance on heavily mounted cavalry to decrease.\n\n&quot;Arquebus&quot; shows all of this in true die-rolling glory, featuring 8 major battles: Fornovo, Cerignola, Agnadello, Ravenna, Marignano, Bicocca, Pavia, and Ceresole. These are all really great game-players, with all but two of them half-mappers playable in 3 hours or less. The other two are the 'tiny' page-sized (8&quot; x 11&quot;) Cerignola and the big one-mapper, the major, final battle of Pavia.

But for gamers, Pavia is wonderful gameplay, with units all over the greatly detailed map, much maneuver and many tough decisions to make.\n\nArquebus uses the popular &quot;Men of Iron&quot; mechanics with much concentration on detail of weaponry, from the differences between closed formation and open, to the decline of the Swiss (pas d'argent? pas de Suisse), and the rise of the German Landsknecht, the major force in warfare of the era and, ironically, the best-dressed men in Europe.

Players are planning cathedral layout and overseeing work at the construction site in tandem, in the same time trying to gain advantage over the opposite player.\n\nThe temple is built by laying square tiles adjacent to the board or already built tiles. Tiles form the plan of the cathedral. These tiles, distinguished by four colors, represent different elements of the cathedral. The pool of tiles available to players is random. Later, the players place pawns on the tiles &ndash; these pawns are the teams of builders: foremen, masons and carpenters, who will make the design a reality.\n\nThe players strive to achieve two goals: to lay their cathedral tiles so as to create the largest possible areas representing a single color, and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.\n\nEvery tile bears also one special action that could be played instead of adding a tile to the cathedral. Using these actions player may move pawns from tile to tile, promote them (increasing their value) or manipulate the tiles. Execution of specific order excludes the tile from being used as part of cathedral, so choice between expanding the edifice and making some action is strategic. Planning and optimal use of available resources is important, as both participants share the same selection of tiles. Thus, tiles and actions shown on them not used by the player in her or his turn become immediately available to his opponent.\n\nSome tiles trigger movement of a special King pawn, which moves along the scoring track. Every few moves, the King pawn comes to a space indicating a royal visit to the cathedral. During each royal visit, the progress of work is assessed and Victory Points are assigned to the players. The number of VPs each player is awarded depends on the size and number of the areas controlled by their pawns at the moment of scoring.

It is the second volume in the Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at L&uuml;tzen in 1632.\n\nThe Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.\n\nArmies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.\n\nThe four battles in Sweden Fights On are:\n\n\n    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634 \n\n\nThough the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated.

The Swedes were drawn into a trap.\n\n\n    Wittstock 1636\n\n\nThe Cannae of the Thirty Years War.

With Gettysburg Wallace wanted to produce a balanced rather than a historically accurate game. The game e.g. ignores casualty levels, and Units do not correspond exactly to brigades or divisions - even if the forces' proportion is close to historical accuracy.\n\nThe player pieces in Gettysburg are similar to those in Treefrog's previous wargame, Waterloo. Each day consists of four periods, and the game is played over three days, and key locations must be held by the end of one period.  Each player has eight numbered 'order blocks', ranking from two to five.  Players then place such blocks in the game areas, the order block allowing a number of orders to be issued that area.  The orders can activate units in the same or adjacent areas.  Orders are represented by discs, once the number of order discs in an area matches the value of the order block then no more orders can be issued.  The players will then have to remove the block and place a new one. If a player does not have enough order discs for the following period, he will be forced to pass for each disc he is short.  Assault combat is similar to Waterloo, the main exceptions are that the attacker and defender use different morale check tables.

The action system is a clever creation: You know the range of possible actions that you can take on a turn, but the opponent knows exactly how many actions you have, and that knowledge strips the certainty from your preparation. Can you get your infantry back in a defensive position before the opponent thunders through with his cavalry? If you don&rsquo;t think you can, you might develop timidly, which gives the opponent a better shot of taking valuable terrain.\n\nDamage in the game is represented by blue/red/black cubes, and you can distribute the cubes throughout your lines during the game to represent the movement of troops back and forth from the front lines. Shifting all the damage to the back seems like a no-brainer, but if cavalry does break through your front line, your troops are toast. Morale is checked only in face-to-face combat, and it&rsquo;s handled by a die roll compared with the level of damage within an area.\n\nControl of areas like La Haye Sainte is critical. Just as Wellington tried to funnel French attacks through gaps in ridges in order to cut off their support, you can do the same, fighting for highland to prevent being pinched. The French win if they take Mont St. Jean, the British if they take Rosonne; if neither occurs before the end of 8pm (ie the last turn), then the British and Allies win.", "['Deduction', 'Puzzle', 'Real-time'] ['Cooperative Game'] Can you solve the riddle of a lost painting by Vincent van Gogh?", "['Music'] ['Hand Management', 'Set Collection'] Shop for vintage records and create music collections to rival your peers.", "['Aviation \\\\/ Flight', 'Collectible Components', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame'] ['Simultaneous Action Selection'] Engage in aerial dogfights with a dieselpunk alternate 1930s backdrop.", "['American Civil War', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Line of Sight', 'Simulation'] (from MMP website:)\n\nLast Chance for Victory is the next entry in The Gamers&rsquo; Line of Battle series (LoB) which simulates the Battle of Gettysburg. It is the second game in the series, following the well received None But Heroes about the Battle of Antietam.\n\nThe story of Gettysburg is well known or, I should say, the popular rendition of the battle is well known and has certainly been simulated multiple times.\n\nAs is usually the case with stripped down, accepted versions of complex events, this narrative misses much flavor and a deeper understanding of what went on. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;auto-tour&rsquo; version of a much more involved event.\n\nMany things are simply not brought out, or put into proper context, in the affirmed version of the battle:\n\n1)     Lee arrived on the field and tried to get his footing when Ewell (on his own initiative) ordered Rodes and Early to attack. Lee wasted no time in ordering Hill to attack with Heth and Pender to support Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. In the commonly held view, Lee arrived and simply dithered while events unfolded outside his control.\n\n2)    There were several opportunities that afternoon and evening to advance and take Cemetery and/or Culp&rsquo;s Hills. These were missed&hellip; but not, as commonly assumed, because one or more leaders were staring at their navels confused or indecisive. What happened and why?\n\n3)    Ewell made a clear headed decision his men were in no condition to take the hill that evening. He was the commander on the spot. Since then historians and armchair generals everywhere have questioned that decision, the game allows you to see who was right. Ewell was of the opinion that he could only do it if 3rd Corps supported him. That support was ordered by Lee (using 3rd Corps&rsquo; artillery) but was not implemented by the army&rsquo;s chief of artillery. Would that have allowed the attack to work? What was the relative condition of the Union defenders and the potential attacking troops anyway?\n\n4)    There never was any sort of &lsquo;dawn attack&rsquo; order, but there were orders to attack much earlier on the second day than actually occurred. The game allows you to find out what went wrong (so you can draw your own conclusions as to who to blame).\n\n5)    By evening of the 2nd day, the fate of Cemetery Ridge rested in the hands of a handful of formed Union regiments (including the human sacrifice of the 1st Minnisota). Confederate victory was very, very close&mdash;teetering in the balance much more than normally assumed. There was a reason Lee said that if Dorsey Pender remained in command for another 30 minutes, the Confederates would have won the battle. See just how tough the Union job was and how close to the edge they got. What would have been the result of that 2nd day&rsquo;s attack had it launched just a few hours earlier or even at the same time, but with the coordinated use of Anderson&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions?\n\n6)    Everyone assumes Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was a forlorn, desperate, throw of the dice, but what was the condition of many of the Union units manning that ridge? Was this attack a complete reworking of the Confederate battle plan out of blind frustration or was it a continuation of the plan from both earlier days? What was the earlier, theoretically coordinated, plan the attack was ad libbed from?\n\n7)    As a whole, the popular version of the battle pretty much assumes a Union victory unless multiple stars aligned for the Confederates. If this is so, did the Army of the Potomac have to merely put out a &lsquo;fair-to-middl&rsquo;in&rsquo; effort or did they have to fight tooth and nail to gain victory? If the latter, just how close of a run was it? Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;assuming they will win&rdquo; take away well earned credit they had for finally overcoming a determined and usually successful foe?\n\nLast Chance for Victory attempts to allow players to find their own answers to these questions and points as well as many others. The added depth and nuance makes for a very different and, in my opinion, more accurate rendition of the battle than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before.\n\nAside from showing the history in a way that will be both entertaining but make you thirst for more and better reading on the topic, multiple variations are provided to explore the battle. Sure, there are the usual &ldquo;extra troops&rdquo; variants, but more importantly, options that allow players to tweak the various historical behavior &lsquo;knobs&rsquo; I assigned. If you think my &lsquo;setting&rsquo; for Howard (to pull a name out of a hat) are all wet, you can change him to be better (or worse) so you can see how your version &lsquo;plays.&rsquo; Likewise, a number of rules simulate activities that were pretty much out of the player&rsquo;s hands (such as Buford&rsquo;s need to screen the town yet keep his losses very low), these can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; as desired to see what effect they really have on the battle. There is a matrix of the various &lsquo;control&rsquo; rules and the possible &lsquo;settings&rsquo; for each one that players can use before starting if they disagree with my decisions. The results of your choices might surprise you and spur your understanding of the battle to new levels.\n\nAs with None But Heroes, Last Chance for Victory is designed to bring all of this and much more to your table in the most historically accurate and informational jam-packed game possible. Like any LoB game, it was designed with twin goals: the most insight possible and a game with maximum playability.\n\nEnhancing the already well received and streamlined Line of Battle rules, Last Chance for Victory comes with the v2.0 series rules. These rules incorporate the refinements and suggestions of hundreds of real players which make this smooth system even faster to play. Make no mistake, this is the only regimental level Gettysburg game that can be played to completion at a respectable clip&mdash;yet it is a large game. A pair of reasonably fast players could play the campaign game to completion at a convention like ConsimExpo. I&rsquo;ve completed campaign games with three players in a week of rather relaxed play time.\n\nScenarios abound of various sizes. The campaign uses a 4-map &lsquo;box&rsquo; layout, but the game comes with two additional maps, one covering just the 1st Day&rsquo;s fighting and the other the 2nd and 3rd Day&rsquo;s. The big game scenarios can be played on one or both of those maps and, with those two linked together, it is possible to play the entire battle on 2 maps.\n\nIt replaces This Hallowed Ground from the RSS-series.", "['Puzzle'] ['Connections', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Follow', 'Line Drawing', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Mark unique constellations on the rotating maps!", "['Nautical', 'Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Area-Impulse', 'Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Points', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Secret Unit Deployment'] (from Compass Games website:)\n\nSteel Wolves is a solitaire simulation of the German submarine war against British and Allied shipping, the follow-on title to the award winning Silent War.

But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.\n\nIn mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.\n\nIn August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective.

The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.\n\n2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.\n\n3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?\n\n4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops.

From approximately 1700 BC to 1200 BC (which was the abrupt end of the Bronze Age) the chariot reigned supreme on the battlefield. It was the first modern weapons system, and chariots controlled most of warfare until actual cavalry appeared in the middle of the Iron Age.\n  \nBut how did chariots work as a tactical weapons system? There is no complete historical agreement on what exactly they did or how they were used, but Chariots of Fire will show you our view of their many applications - and many types of chariotry there were - providing GBoH players with the complete and definitive chariot rules. These rules cover combat and mobility from the first battle wagons of the Sumerians to the two-man, fast-moving light chariots of the Egyptians, often complete with their associated and specialized Runner Infantry, to the heavy 3-man Hittite wheels.\n To simulate these ancient tactical details Chariots of Fire presents you with nine battles:\nSumer (ca 2320 BC) - featuring the legendary Sargon the Great\nSekhmen (1875 BC)\nMegiddo (ca 1479 BC)\nSenzar (1470)\nThe Astarpa (1312 BC)\nKadesh (1300 BC)\nNihriya (1230 BC)\nBabylon (1225 BC)\nand Troy (1200 BC) - including an extra: Homer's heros!\n\nAnd of armies Chariots of Fire has plenty, and a truly colorful bunch they are: Sumerians, Akkadians, all sorts of Egyptians, Canaanites, Hittites, Mitanni, Arzawans, Assyrians, Babylonians, and the Mycenaean Age Greeks.\n\nGame Features\nTIME SCALE     20 minutes per turn  \nMAP SCALE     100 yards per hex\nUNIT SCALE      350 men per mounted unit \nPLAYING TIME     1-3 hours\n\n\n(from BGG description:)\n\nHistorical Note: The period following The Bronze Age, from what is known as The Catastrophe of ca. 1200 BC to the rise of the Greek city-states, is almost totally devoid of any sort of information, and that includes archaeological  remains.

Every wargamer knows this battle was a severe Allied setback. What is not obvious, however, is that Allied troops on the ground gave a good account of themselves against the remnants of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Korps, despite the ineffective and confused leadership that existed at Corps level.\n\nIn the end, while GIs and Tommies fought their guts out to make up for the mistakes of their leadership, the advantages achieved by initial Axis successes were allowed to blow away in the wind by an equally detached and confused Axis High Command. In its case, how to best exploit the results of their initial attack depended on an argument raging within the Italian Commando Supremo and the persuasive abilities of Albert Kesselring and Erwin Rommel. After much discussion and the loss of several crucial days, the Axis decided on the less ambitious plan, which was itself no longer even possible.\n\nBaptism By Fire is the second game in the Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP), which took players by storm with its block buster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge. The game is designed as a more accessible entry to the system for those who want something smaller and faster than the earlier monster game. Here the wide open desert, limited number of Formations, and short scenario length provide players with a rapid and fun introduction to the series, the chance to develop their play skills to become a more effective BCS player overall, and to take a good look at this poorly understood battle.\n\nOnce again, the masterful order of battle research by Carl Fung showcases the forces involved with more fine detail than ever before. As a result, the common misconceptions of hapless GIs and Afrika Korps supermen is put to rest.\n\nTo give players a better feel for the pulse of the battle, the Germans run rampant for a few turns but then must idle back for several more while their commanders figure out what the overall objective will be. The player selects this objective randomly in the middle of the game, and it determines his Victory Conditions. This precludes the Axis player from overusing his limited combat power beforehand (since he might be going down the wrong road, literally) and keeps the Allies off balance as they must protect against both possibilities.\n\nWith a campaign game of only 10 turns, multiple plays are readily possible and various strategies for both sides can be explored.\n\nScenarios:\n\n    Kasserine Campaign, 2 maps, 10 Turns\n    Operation Spring Wind, 1 map, 4 Turns\n    Mid-Campaign Start, 2 maps, 5 Turns\n    Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 1 map, 5 Turns\n    End Campaign Start, 2 maps, 3 Turns\n    High Water Mark, 1 map, 3 Turns\n\n\nComponents:\n\n    BCS rulebook (version 1.1, in full color)\n    Two BCS Charts and Tables\n    BCS Crib Notes Booklet\n    BBF Game Specific rulebook\n    Two 22&rdquo; x34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps\n    560 Counters (one sheet of units and one BCS marker sheet)\n    6 scenarios total, 3 one-map scenarios\n    Box and Dice\n\n\nGame Scale:\n\n    Turn: 1 day\n    Hex: 1 mile\n    Units: Battalion (w/a few Companies)\n\n\n(description from MMP website and user)", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Grid Movement', 'Mancala', 'Set Collection'] Erupt stacks to send pyramids across the grid and score.", "['Adventure', 'Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Horror', 'Party Game'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hidden Roles', 'Player Elimination', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers'] Werewolves, vampires, and humans deduce who's who while obtaining items and goals.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Animals', 'Bluffing'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', \"Prisoner's Dilemma\"] Fight or share...

There are 3 explorer tokens (red, yellow, blue) and 2 types of cards: equipment and explorer (players start with equal number, same mix of cards; there are face up cards and face down draw decks). Explorer cards are used to move explorers (3 colors; 1 card = 1 movement pt for that color explorer) while equipment cards modify movement.\n\nIn the first 2 parts, on your turn you either take 3 cards (any combination of face up/down explorer/equipment cards) OR move orthogonally; if moving, must advance (1 level deeper in mountain, 1 column further across in lake) at least 1 row/column. Each space costs 1 MP; some cost more (shown as 2 or 3 rocks). Equipment allows you to move diagonally, or get across pits/whirlpools, or make rock-spaces only cost 1 MP, or give you bonus MP. Moving over some spaces gives you a water token. If you end on specific spaces, you may discard a combination of 1-3 equipment cards (pictured on board) to draw as many fossil cards (lamp allows you to draw an extra fossil card to choose from). At the end of the Mountain part, you may keep 3 fossil cards for every water you discard. In the lake phase, all explorers are on 1 raft, so any single color may be used to move the entire raft.\n\nAfter moving and resolving lake space effects, draw a random event card (may hurt someone or give bonus VP if [un]able to discard specific combo of explorer cards). The player getting the first explorer to the end of the Mountain, or the raft to the end of the Lake, scores bonus 4 VP. In the final Volcano phase, draw random explorer card and move raft to next like-colored space; players must discard cards shown, or pay penalty.\n\nAt the end, score VP = sum of values of fossils (various types, sets score higher if you have more parts of the set) + bonus VP + 1 VP/water token.

Playing from the perspective of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, your goal is to defeat and pacify three different tribes while managing off-map wars and rebellions, troop shortages, limited resources, and the effects of plague&mdash;all while maintaining your standing with the Senate and people of Rome.\n\nThe Marcomannic Wars were a series of conflicts fought by the Romans against a loose coalition of German and Sarmatian tribes along the Danube from 166CE to 180CE. After crushing a Roman army and killing as many as 20,000 Roman soldiers near Carnuntum, German barbarians ravaged the Danube provinces and besieged Aquileia, marking the first time a hostile force had entered Italy in nearly 300 years. Meanwhile, Sarmatians invaded Dacia and Costoboci descended deep into the Balkans and Greece as far as Athens. It took Rome more than a decade to restore peace, with war and plague extracting a terrible cost of human and material resources.\n\nThe game covers the war from the disastrous Battle of Carnuntum in 170CE to Marcus Aurelius' death in 180CE. Each turn (lasting one year) is divided into four rounds: early campaign, late campaign, winter and an attrition/house keeping round.\n\nAt the start of each round, the player draws three barbarian cards and resolves their effects. Barbarian cards activate enemy tribes (restoring their morale or causing them to advance), trigger off-map conflicts, or cause special events such as plague, mutiny, or rebellions.\n\nOn their turn, the Roman player draws a set number of cards (5 during the early campaign, 3 during the late campaign, and 1 during winter) and plays as many or few as they choose for either actions or events. Actions include: attacking barbarian tribes; building forts; moving legions; and increasing &quot;Imperium Points.&rdquo; Many cards can also be played for historically based events, such as the &quot;Lightning miracle&quot; depicted on the Column of Marcus Aurelius; and the &quot;Galen&quot; event that mitigates the effects of plague. All cards must be used by the end of the year or discarded, except for one card that can be held over into the next year by use of the &quot;Meditations&quot; deck.\n\nBattles are resolved by rolling 1d6 for the Romans and 1d6 for the Barbarians. The Roman role is modified by the number of legions assigned to the front and the combat rating of the leader. Cards can be spend to commit &quot;reserves&quot; to avoid a defeat or eke out a victory. Other cards including &quot;Ambush,&quot; &quot;Tactical Superiority&quot; and &quot;Route&quot; can affect the outcome of battles. Enemy die rolls are modified by the morale of the tribe and the terrain, representing the barbarians' knowledge of the lands north of the Danube and Romans' difficulties in maintaining supply lines.\n\nPlayers can lose in a number of ways: if the Marcomanni break through into Italy the game immediately ends. Suddenly death also occurs if the player's Imperium Points (IP) drop into &quot;usurpation.&quot; If all three tribes have not been defeated and pacified by 180CE the game also ends in a loss.\n\nThe player wins by driving barbarians back into their home space and defeating them there. Once a tribe is defeated they must be kept pacified by building forts and keeping troops assigned to garrisons, or they may break their treaty and rejoin the fight (as happened historically). Final victory occurs if all three tribes have surrendered. The player's score takes into account the number of years that have elapsed, their IP level, and the number of off-map conflicts they have resolved.", "['Transportation'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Line Drawing', 'Network and Route Building', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Set Collection'] Avoid traffic and drop off passengers to create the best bus route in all of Kyoto.", "['Adventure', 'Science Fiction'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Storytelling', 'Variable Player Powers'] Enter Martin's mind to discover his inner demon and free him from his coma.", "['Dice'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Income'] Miller, farmer, innkeeper, or mayor?

It is a one hour of real time per turn game that can be completed in 5 to 10 hours of play. Beside the full battle game, several scenarios are available (Hougoumont, D'Erlon attack, Plancenoit). In addition, what if options will allow players to simulate alternate history variations to the battle.\n\nFallen Eagles provides a detailed view of the battle but in a playable way. The focus is on morale, attrition and commitment of formation (division &amp; corps) at the right time, rather than tactical chrome. The detailed order of battle and the scale of the game allow players to really see the action and the game system provides a quick but realistic resolution.\n\nA new system has been created and combat result tables have been tested against actual historical results of this battle. This system is a mix of well-known concepts and new features to maximize playability and realism of outcomes.\n\nFormation are given simple orders than limit their ability to freely react to any sudden change of priority. Orders take some time a while before being changed. Units are classically rated for size, quality and movement. Formations activate one after the other at player's choice but have to follow the order they received at the beginning of the turn or even before. Game features offensive fire, defensive fire, opportunity fire, charge and counter charge, retreat before combat and melee. A lot of classical &quot;prohibitions&quot; are transformed into options: for example, cavalry can move from ZOC to ZOC but risk counter charges or more opportunity fire. A ZOC of a strong unit is therefore not the same as the ZOC of a weaker one.\n\nThe game turn has a random ending procedure and players are never sure to have time to move all their formation reflecting the command control issues of any battle. Also, the fatigue and friction factors are built in a potentially shorter turn length in the latter stages of the battle. Focus on morale and attrition is a testimony of a battle which was a test of will of two densely packed armies fighting head to head. Players will have to choose which unit will &quot;lead&quot; the attack and take the first fire. Failing a key morale test can make the difference between a stalled attack or a promising breakthrough.\n\nGame variations will include, for example, the Prussian arrival sooner or later than history, or a better weather the day before allowing for an earlier start of the french attack.\n\nVictory is determined with &quot;sudden death&quot; objectives given to both sides in order to simulate historical constraints but also by control of key objectives and losses at the end of the game.\n\nAccording to Wellington, Waterloo was a &quot;near run thing&quot;. Will the thin red line hold against the French furia again?\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t================================================================(traduction fran&ccedil;aise du texte anglais:)\n\nWaterloo 1815, la chute des Aigles est un jeu de niveau r&eacute;giment / bataillon de la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre bataille.\n\nLe jeu comprend un peu plus de 400 pions (ordre de bataille fran&ccedil;ais, anglo-alli&eacute; et prussien du 18 Juin 1815), une carte 108 par 75 cm (200 m&egrave;tres par hexagone), diverses aides de jeu, un livret de r&egrave;gle et un livret de jeu. L'&eacute;chelle est d'une heure par tour et le jeu peut &ecirc;tre termin&eacute; en 5 &agrave; 10 heures. En plus de la bataille compl&egrave;te, plusieurs sc&eacute;narios sont disponibles (Hougoumont, d'Erlon attaque, Plancenoit). Des options permettront aux joueurs d'explorer des alternatives.\n\nLa chute des Aigles propose une vue d&eacute;taill&eacute;e mais jouable de la bataille. L'accent est mis sur le moral, l'attrition et l'engagement des formations (division et corps) au moment opportun, plut&ocirc;t que sur le chrome tactique. L'ordre de bataille d&eacute;taill&eacute; et l'&eacute;chelle du jeu permettent aux joueurs d'entrer dans l'action. Le syst&egrave;me offre une r&eacute;solution rapide mais r&eacute;aliste des combats.\n\nUn nouveau syst&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute; et les tables de combat ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s par rapport aux r&eacute;sultats historiques. Ce syst&egrave;me est un m&eacute;lange de concepts bien connus et de nouvelles fonctionnalit&eacute;s pour optimiser jouabilit&eacute; et r&eacute;alisme.\n\nDes ordres simples sont donn&eacute;s aux formations, limitant leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;agir &agrave; un changement soudain de priorit&eacute;. Les ordres peuvent se poursuivent avant d'&ecirc;tre chang&eacute;s. Les unit&eacute;s sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on habituelle par la taille, la qualit&eacute; et le mouvement. Les formations sont activ&eacute;es les unes apr&egrave;s les autres, au choix du joueur, mais doivent suivre l'ordre qu'elles ont re&ccedil;u au d&eacute;but du tour, voire avant. Le jeu inclut le feu offensif et d&eacute;fensif, les tirs d'opportunit&eacute;, la charge et la contre-charge, la retraite avant combat et la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Un grand nombre d'&quot;interdictions&quot; classiques sont transform&eacute;es en options : par exemple, la cavalerie peut se d&eacute;placer de ZDC (zone de contr&ocirc;le) &agrave; ZDC, mais est menac&eacute;e par la contre-charge ou le feu d'opportunit&eacute;. Une ZDC d'une unit&eacute; puissante n'est donc pas la m&ecirc;me que la ZDC d'une unit&eacute; plus faible.\n\nLe tour de jeu comprend une fin de tour al&eacute;atoire. Les joueurs ne sont jamais certains de disposer de toutes leurs formations, refl&eacute;tant les probl&egrave;mes de commandement durant toute bataille. En outre, la fatigue et la &quot;friction&quot; se traduisent dans des tours de jeu potentiellement plus courts &agrave; la fin. L'accent mis sur ?âle moral et l'usure, est un reflet de cette bataille qui fut une &eacute;preuve de d&eacute;termination pour ces deux arm&eacute;es, denses et combattant pied &agrave; pied. Les joueurs devront choisir l'unit&eacute; en t&ecirc;te qui conduira l'attaque et subira le premier feu. L'&eacute;chec d'un test de moral peut faire la diff&eacute;rence entre une attaque avort&eacute;e ou une perc&eacute;e prometteuse.\n\nLes variantes pr&eacute;voient, par exemple, l'arriv&eacute;e pr&eacute;coce ou tardive des Prussiens, ou une meilleure m&eacute;t&eacute;o la veille, permettant une attaque fran&ccedil;aise plus t&ocirc;t.\n\nLa victoire est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; la fois par des objectifs de &quot;mort subite&quot; donn&eacute;s aux deux camps afin de simuler les contraintes historiques pendant l'action, mais aussi par le contr&ocirc;le d'objectifs et les pertes inflig&eacute;es en fin de partie.\n\nSelon Wellington, Waterloo fut une &laquo;affaire tr&eacute;s serr&eacute;e&raquo;.

The mayor, Henry-Cat, has signed a trade agreement with the newly-discovered continent of Felinia.

Investment cards provide cash payouts, with bigger payouts for collecting sets of different values (single cards are worth less than three-card sets).  Artists provide a potentially large source of victory points, but require multiple turns of patronage (i.e., cash) before they pay out.  Colonization cards provide ships, captains, and cannons to outfit expeditions to establish colonies which earn victory points and access to the higher-paying spice investment card deck.  Civics cards can provide governorships in the provinces (victory points and income), civic improvements (victory points), a special action that allows the holder to alter the normal rules for advancing a token on the board track.

One player controls the French forces, and the other player controls the Viet Minh forces.\n\nIn the spring of 1954, General Giap shocked the world by doing what had previously been considered impossible&mdash;defeating a Western occupying force. Storm Over Dien Bien Phu simulates the climactic moment when the isolated French forces (composed of French legionnaires and elite paratrooper units), and crumbled under the unrelenting pressure of the Chinese&ndash;backed Viet Minh forces.\n\nUsing the Area Move system redefined in Storm Over Stalingrad, the game features the use of cards to augment game play, adding to the tension experienced by both sides. The rules are similar in length to those seen in Storm Over Stalingrad, and are of the same level of complexity, with additions made for the situations encountered in this battle.\n\nAdditional rules added to the game include sapping, assaulting, and the French supply situation. In addition to these new rules, new cards have been created in order to represent events encountered during the battle. These include &ldquo;Detonate Mine Shaft&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rats of the Nam Yum&rdquo;, &ldquo;Giap Demands Success&rdquo;, &ldquo;Propaganda&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&eacute;bouchez &agrave; Z&eacute;ro!&rdquo;, and &ldquo;B-26 Bombers&rdquo;.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 1 week\nMap: Area\nUnit: Infantry Platoons/Companies\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet\nOne and a half countersheets (264 5/8&quot; counters)\nOne 12 page Game Rulebook\nCard deck with 55 full-color cards\nFour six-sided dice\n\nComplexity - Low\nSolitaire suitability - Low\nPlaying time - Up to 3 hours\n\nDesigner: Nick Richardson\nDeveloper: Brian Youse\nGame Artwork: Nicolas Eskubi", "['Dice', 'Movies \\\\/ TV \\\\/ Radio theme', 'Print & Play', 'Science Fiction'] ['Contracts', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Worker Placement'] Do you have what it takes to survive?", "['Economic', 'Trains', 'Transportation'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Network and Route Building', 'Stock Holding', 'Tile Placement'] A massive 18xx covering Canada from coast to coast.", "['Card Game'] ['Hand Management', 'Set Collection', 'Trick-taking'] Avoid playing the high card or low card; find the middle path in this trick-taker.", "['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting'] ['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Player Elimination'] An &quot;old school&quot; fantasy card game for players with a rich imagination.", "['Age of Reason', 'Negotiation', 'Wargame'] ['Hexagon Grid', 'Open Drafting', 'Variable Phase Order'] Outwit your opponents' secret agenda as you wage war together against Bourbon forces.", "['Animals'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Set Collection'] &quot;Choose your area, start your boomerangs, capture the animal ... and beware of other players.\n\nAuction game of bluff.

You are placed in the role of the Commonwealth Commander in the theatre, and must utilize every resource at your disposal to fend off unrelenting Axis attacks in order to ensure the survival of the island of Malta.\n\nBuilt upon the same States of Siege engine as the designer's previous 2010 Charles S. Roberts award-winning release (We Must Tell the Emperor), Malta Besieged features both familiar and innovative game play. Supply was the key element in the Mediterranean Campaign, and so it is here as well. Players will have to safely shepherd vulnerable convoys - and their valuable cargoes - in order to effectively wage war. With the ability to trade Supply for extra Actions at the most crucial moments, this places an additional emphasis on that precious resource and also creates extremely tense convoy battles which will resolve as the game progresses.\n\nULTRA is a crucial asset in the game, but beware of Axis counterintelligence! Spitfires can rule the skies, Gibraltar can block U-Boat advances, Operation Herkules is a constant threat, and Admiral Cunningham himself can intervene on occasion.\n\nNorth Africa is not treated as a mere sideshow; indeed, the struggle with Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox&quot;, holds the ultimate key to victory... if Malta can hold out against the constant pressure. If a fortified Tobruk manages to stubbornly delay the vaunted Afrika Korps long enough, then General Montgomery and his battle-tested 8th Army can possibly make a final dash from El Alamein to capture Tripoli and secure a glorious triumph.\n\nRaiding Axis supply lines to weaken Rommel's Situation, scrambling Hurricanes to provide Air Support for inbound shipping, attacking the Italians early before the dreaded Luftwaffe arrives, requesting British Fleet escort for your individually named convoys, and maintaining the morale of a battered Malta are just some of the important decisions to be made throughout the game. Numerous theatre-wide events such as The Fall of France, O'Connor's desert offensive, the daring raid on the Italian Fleet at Taranto, the Air Assault on Crete, the evacuation from Greece, the sinking of the aircraft carrier Ark Royal, and the Torch landings are all abstracted via card play, and can have a significant impact on the overall conduct of the war.\n\nWith That Scorpion of the Sea: Malta Besieged, it's all here - the only question is will you have the wisdom, leadership, fortitude, and luck to prevail?

The new babies have no beanometer, so harvesting a field topped by a baby is worthless; when a baby is planted in a field, however, a female bean in the field can move two cards toward the top of the stack, which means the babies can bring the superior females where they are needed most.\n\nIn English, Ladybohn: Manche m&ouml;gen's heiss! is included in the standalone expansion Bohnanza: Ladies &amp; Gangsters.", "['Fantasy', 'Miniatures', 'Wargame'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Measurement Movement', 'Variable Player Powers'] A fantasy miniatures game that is based on the same system as De Bellis Antiquitatis: Quick Play Wargame Rules with Army Lists for Ancient and Medieval Battles and De Bellis Multitudinis: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles ??3000 BC to 1500 AD. The first edition was published in 1991, with a much more clearly written second edition being published in 2002. The game consists of a single rulebook.\n\nThe player's miniatures are organized onto stands or 'elements', an army consisting of about 10-14 such elements. Troop types range from powerful Heroes, Magicians, and Dragons, through such things as Blades, Riders, and Spears and down to the humble Hordes of the game title.\n\nMovement is alternate, with each player dicing for action points (PIPs) which allow them to move single elements or groups of elements, deploy certain element types and use magicians to be-spell enemy troops. Combat between elements is resolved by each player rolling a die and adding the element's combat factor. Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.\n\nThe strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies. With only a few restrictions (concerned with which elements can be generals and the proportion of 'powerful' troop types) you can construct your army any way you wish. This means you can create armies to represent those from any work of fantasy fiction, myth, legend, film, TV, anything else that your imagination desires.

Players can win the game by winning two rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing two rounds.\n\nThe game is played in rounds. Each round, the player sets up the base character &mdash; one of eight heroes in the box &mdash; and all the equipment this character has. This one character represents every player being a fully-equipped dungeon delver.\n\nThe start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn. If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and remove a piece of equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment currently on the character.\n\nThe player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allows you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round; if not, they lose.

This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.\n\nCOMPONENTS:\n\n     Three 22 x 34 inch maps\n     One 24 x 34 inch map\n     1120 counters\n     Series rule book plus a scenarios book\n     Various player aid cards for charts and tables\n     Set up cards for each scenario\n\n\nTHE GAME\n\nThis comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.\n\nDespite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.\n\nNote that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.\n\nBarbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?\n\nTHE SCENARIOS\n\n\n     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.\n     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.\n     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?\n     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.\n     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?\n     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?\n     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles.

Playable by 1 to 2 players in 1 hour, the game comes with a card-driven solitaire engine.  Designed by Maurice Suckling (designer of Freeman's Farm 1777), the game uses many of the concepts from that game.  However, added hidden movement, much more maneuver, and other design tweaks make this a truly unique game.\n\nEach turn players will play 1 of their 3 in-hand formation cards to maneuver or attack enemy forces, gaining momentum cubes based on the formation activated.  Each formation is a Confederate division or Union corps.  Each formation card will allow a major and possibly an additional minor activation, major allowing two moves for a formation while the minor allows one move.  After each formation moves combat can occur if a move ends in a location with an enemy formation.  Tactic cards may be played during the formation's activation giving it movement or combat bonuses.\n\nAt the end of the formation card activation players may spend their momentum cubes to buy tactics cards which may give them benefits in combat or movement in future turns.\n\nPlayers then draw a new formation card refilling their hands to 3.  Hooker, Lee, and Jackson have bonuses that can be played once a game, adding to movement and combat.\n\nVictory is determined by destroying enemy formations through morale/strength loss, or the Union occupying the three victory locations which represent cutting off the Confederate army from Richmond.\n\nAdditional rules allow for fixed defensive positions, Jackson's Flank March -- and even his death.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Medieval', 'Miniatures', 'Renaissance'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Grid Movement', 'Role Playing', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Variable Player Powers'] Become the Hunter protecting human settlements in renaissance post-apocalyptic world.", "['Card Game', 'Collectible Components', 'Fantasy'] [] The game you already know how to play!

The game focuses on cavalry and archery action, featuring mounted archers of exceptional skill. Devil's Horsemen depicts the four major battles of the era - The Indus, The Kalka, Liegnitz and Ayn Jalut.\n\nDevil's Horsemen features basic rules for both regular and SimpleGBoH play. The rules bring the system into full flower of mounted archery, with a detailed, augmented set of archery and cavalry mechanics that include various types of Shower Fire (as opposed to plain Volley Fire), Impetuosity and Aggression, Feigned Retreat, Harass and Disperse tactics, and Rally to Standards, with the various armies and units being rated for their ability to use these.\n\nDevil's Horsemen presens a truly colorful array of armies for you to lead into battle: there are 10 full tumen (divisions) of Mongols, plus Polovtsians, Galicians, Chernigovians, Kievans, Persian Khwarazmians, Poles, Silesians, Bohemians, the great Teutonic Knights, and the first army to ever significantly defeat the Mongols, The Mamluks.\n\nThese mighty armies show up in four great battles of the period (ranging from battles needing 1/2 mapsheet to two full-mapsheets).\n\nThe Indus (Genghis Khan vs. Shah Jalal ad-Din and the Khwarazmian Persians, 1221). One mapsheet in size, this is the battle that gave The Mongols control over all of Central Asia.\n     \nThe Kalka (Prince Subudei vs. the combined Armies of Rus, 1223).

A 1/2 mapsheet battle which introduced Europe to the Mongols, and from which we get the famous Christian prayer of the era, From the Fury of the Tartars, oh Lord, Deliver Us.

(A particular favorite holiday of ours, as Sandi and I were married on that day in Marietta Confederate Cemetery.) It is short (about 30 minutes), and rather brain bending.\n\nDia De Los Muertos (Day Of The Dead) is played over three days as you send animals, then children, then adults on to the afterlife. It is a basic trick taking game, except that most cards have an action with them. You play as a partnership, and if your side wins scoring cards (the dead or food), you exchange a card with your opponent. Other cards allow swaps between partners, asking a question, cancelling other cards and so on.\n\nThe first time you play, there's a lot of checking the rules, checking the crib sheet, remembering if you exchange cards. You spend more time figuring the game than playing the tricks. But after a couple of hands, it makes sense and you switch to game-playing mode. And here's where it pays. If you enjoy Bridge, you can figure out what your partner signals when they swap a card, or you can read the deck based on what's been played, you will really enjoy Dia De Los Muertos. If you don't like Bridge, or can't figure trick-taking games anyway, steer well clear. It is rather brain-bending.\n\nThe original game has nice native graphics of the dead abroad and has a variant for 3 players. The re-issue as Four Dragons has an oriental theme.\n\nNot to be confused with:\n\n     Dia de los Muertos (2007)\n     Dia de los Muertos (2016)", "['Ancient', 'City Building', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Mythology'] ['Action Points', 'Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Open Drafting', 'Stock Holding'] Gather followers, fight off enemies and climb the steps to divinity.", "['Card Game', 'Sports'] ['Simulation'] A perennial NBA simulation with detailed player cards and results deck.", "['Adventure', 'Animals', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Variable Player Powers'] Navigate the battlefield and work together to stop a war.", "['Deduction', 'Dice'] ['Worker Placement', 'Worker Placement with Dice Workers'] Welcome to Pie Town, a community built on apples and butter.

For this, they have two workers, a large one and a smaller one, and a set of 5 cards for each worker to move them. There is a scale with counters (for each worker 1 counter) depicting which worker moves first, second and so on).\n                                                 \nIn a turn, all players secretly choose one of the numbered cards from each of their card sets.\n\nFor the worker which is the first to move, the player revealed the appropriate card and moves his worker the amount of spaces as stated by his card. When one of the workers land on an occupied space, the (passive) worker is pushed to the opposite side of the warehouse. When this place is already occupied the (passive) worker won't move. The (active) worker will be moved back to the next unoccupied place.\nWhen all players have made their moves, the warehouses are checked if there is a worker next to a chamber. Players take as many drums in their colour as barrels in the room they are next to. The barrels are placed in one or more of the ships in the harbour (4 ships); players may decide freely.  \n                                                  \nWhen a worker is next to a room where broken barrels are, the player must take as many drums in his colour from any of the ships. When a worker is next to a room depicting also a silver coin, the player gets a silver piece from the common stock.\nMajorities with barrels on ships are important for scoring points. When a ship is fully loaded, or if it is the leftmost ship, loaded or not, it gets scored at the end of the round after which it is taken away (barrels/drums goes back to the players stock); the other ships move left accordingly and a new ship is taken from a blind stack of ships tiles.  \nThere are scores for first, second and third positions (the latter in a game of 3 or 4 players) on the ship. \nFor the next round the last worker (in play order) will become first worker (shifting the counter on the scale).\n\nFor three silver coins an extra worker for the current round can be bought, but this worker always must be the first to move in a round. This worker gets no penalty if his move ends near a room with broken barrels.\n\nThe configuration of the warehouse cards each game is different, as these are loose tiles. When the stack is depleted, the game ends.\n \nGame Summary\nThe board shows a randomly ordered group of 7/8 (3er/4er) warehouses, each with 2 rooms containing 0-4 good barrels or 0-2 broken barrels, and 0-1 coin. This is surrounded by a looped movement path with stops in front of each storeroom. Players each have 2 dock workers (Big and Little) which start at opposite ends of the board (off the path initially), and 2 sets of movement cards numbered 1-5 (one set per worker). There are 4 piers, each with a random boat with room for 3 or more barrels. At the start, pier 1 has a &quot;pilot&quot; boat -- occupies space but cannot load goods. Finally, token movement order is set randomly at the beginning of the game: chits corresponding to all workers are placed in a row in random order.\n\nEach round, players first have the option to pay 3 coins to hire Lazy Jack for this turn (if several want to hire him, priority goes to player with fewer VP). Place the Lazy Jack token with one of your workers. Then, everyone selects and simultaneously reveals a movement card for each worker. If you hired Lazy Jack, play an additional card of the same type (Big/Little) as whoever you placed Lazy Jack with. The workers than all move in token movement order, with Lazy Jack moving first. If they land on another worker, they shift that worker to the opposite side of the movement path, unless that space is already occupied; in that case, the moving worker moves backwards to the first empty space on the path.\n\nAfter all tokens have moved, resolve the warehouses in order from one side of the board to the other. If a coin is present, take one from the bank. If there are good barrels in the storeroom, take as many from your stock and load them onto any boat(s). If you take the last open spot, score 1VP and the boat sails: players with barrels on board score VP based on majority (last place scores nothing; ties will score average of sum of ranks, rounding up). Immediately move other boats forward in the pier track, and place a new boat at the last pier. If there are broken barrels in the storeroom, remove as many of your barrels from the boats (exception: Lazy Jack does not unload).\n\nIf there are now 3 or fewer boats in the piers, the game will end -- score all boats and most VP wins.\n\nIf not, the boat at pier 1 scores, then sails away (immediately advance all boats and draw a new one). Finally, if you had dipped into the last 6 boats this turn, randomize the token movement order. Otherwise, the token last in movement order moves up to 1st position.

But along with the excitment of the race comes &quot;trouble&quot; which can lead to a trip to the pits or even taking a driver out of the race.\n\nUtilizing a simple yet elegant system, each driver is rating on gas (passing), brake (defending against getting passed) as well as 6 racing skills.  Also represented is how good a driver is at qualifying as well as how good the pit crew is at fixing the damage along the way.

Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.\n Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.\n\nThe current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play.

Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.\n\nOnce a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.\n\nTo set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!\n\nPick-a-Polar Bear includes two game variants. In the first, the player who has obtained the most cards in the preceding round cannot grab a card that's identical to his top card in the current round. For the second variant, shuffle eight &quot;bonus round&quot; cards into the deck. If when laying out the cards in the grid, the dealer reveals the back of a bonus round card when at least ten cards are on the table, everyone prepares for the bonus round. The dealer reveals this card, which shows two card elements such as upraised arm and goggles, and everyone races to yell out how many cards in the grid feature these two elements. Whoever yells out the correct answer first receives the bonus round card, which is worth 2 points; whoever yells out the wrong answer takes a -2 point penalty card.

You want to mark off as many numbers as possible, but you can mark off a number only if it's to the right of all marked off numbers in the same row. The deck has 44 cards, eleven in each color numbered 2-12; the back of each card shows the number but without the color. Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four other cards are laid out face-down &mdash; that is, with the color hidden &mdash; in a row beside the remaining deck of cards.\n\nOn a turn, a player fills her hand to five cards by drawing from the four cards on display, then refills the card display from the deck. Using the number now visible on the top card of the deck, each player can choose to cross off one instance of this number in one row on her scoresheet. The active player then plays 1-3 cards from her hand, all of which must be the same color. She can cross off the numbers on these cards &mdash; but only if at most one number is missing in the series of numbers to be crossed off. For example, if she discards 2, 3 and 5 in blue, she can cross off these three numbers (assuming that she hasn't crossed off any blue numbers previously); if she discards 2, 3, and 6 in blue, then she can cross off the 2, the 3, the 2 and 3, or the 6.\n\nIf a player has crossed off five numbers in a color, then she can cross off the rightmost number (2 or 12) should the opportunity arise; if she does, she also crosses off a lock token in this color. If the active player can't cross off a number during her turn, she must mark a penalty box.\n\nWhen a player has &quot;locked&quot; two colors on her scoresheet or marked off four penalty boxes, the game ends. Each player tallies her score in each color &mdash; the more numbers crossed off, the more you score &mdash; then sums these totals and subtracts any penalty points.

The first drive on St. Louis had been repulsed and Van Dorn was summoned to take command of the force and launch a new offensive into the heart of Missouri. Van Dorn, an Indian-fighting cavalryman by trade, arrived at the Rebel camp and even though he was quite ill (due to a fall into a river) he immediately roused the troops. He proposed to launch an immediate attack, despite the freezing weather and fatigued state of his troops. Van Dorn force-marched the army north and managed to pull off a classic Napoleonic stratagem - the &ldquo;maneuver sur la derrieres&rdquo;. He placed his army astride the line of communications of his enemy and by any normal military measure this should have been settled the issue for the two armies. But by doing so at such an ill-advised time and at such an inhuman pace the Rebel troops were little more than a frozen and exhausted armed mob when they finally reached their positions. \n Brig. General Sam Curtis was not a man to be intimidated and he realized that he had a fighting chance, even in this seemingly impossible position. Perseverance and hard, smart fighting by men like Colonel Grenville Dodge and others turned what looked to be a potential disaster into a grand victory. The Battle of Pea Ridge secured for the Union all of Missouri and the northern part of Arkansas, resulting in approximately 85,000 square miles becoming Federal-controlled territory.\n\nThis is the second game in the Revolution Games/GMT series of American Civil War games.

Fresh from his victory in Poland, Hitler planned a blow that would knock France out of the war. key to this plan was knife-like attack through the Ardennes to the English Channel which would split the Allied forces moving north to block the expected replay of 1914 and the Maginot Line forces immobile in the south. To add to the trap, the Germans planned the first massive airborne operation of the war. This attack would capture the hinterland of Holland, pave the way for subordinate German Armored thrusts crossing the Maas, and to continue the lure the Allies northward.\n\nFallschirmjaeger covers this bait. The German player plops down an airborne invasion force with the goal of fighting off all-comers until relieved by advancing ground forces. The Dutch, all but abandoned by their French and British Allies, put up a fight for the record books. The German air bridge held on by its fingernail. While the main German drive was never in doubt, these scattered paratroopers had the fight of their lives against a small nation unwilling to succumb without giving the fight everything.\n\nIn the end, the Dutch government had to be evacuated along with the Dutch Gold Reserve, to form a government in exile. They would return after liberation.\n\nThe player must do all these things, or smash the German paratroopers before they are rescued by the Panzers, to win.

Designed by Adam and Brady Sadler (Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game), No Sanctuary puts players in the roles of iconic survivors from The Walking Dead, working together against desperate odds as they navigate a variety of scenarios. Whether the survivors are scavenging for supplies, fighting off waves of the dead, or even standing toe-to-toe with the living, the group must find a way to work together even when its members&rsquo; interests may be at odds.\n\nNo Sanctuary features a unique leadership mechanic in which players take turns assuming the role of the group&rsquo;s leader. Each turn, the leader must choose the group&rsquo;s approach by drawing two event cards and choosing one. Since players cannot discuss this decision, the pressure is on the leader, and the leader alone will pay the price if the group is unable to follow the approach for the turn. Make enough bad decisions, and the leader may have to relinquish his role and let the next survivor take charge of the group.\n\nEach survivor in No Sanctuary comes with a unique deck of cards to represent their special actions and abilities, as well as their flaws. This deck not only drives each survivor&rsquo;s playstyle, but it also serves their health, so hand management is crucial to surviving each scenario. Equally important as staying alive, group morale is an essential part of the game. Many game effects will cause morale to drop, and if it reaches zero, the players lose the game. Maintaining the group&rsquo;s tenuous psychological stability is just as important as staying alive!\n\nWith its unique gameplay and innovative leadership mechanic, No Sanctuary offers players a deep and engaging way to experience their favorite episodes of The Walking Dead, and even explore beyond the show&rsquo;s storylines!", "['Adventure', 'Economic', 'Exploration', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Bribery', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Legacy Game', 'Voting', 'Worker Placement, Different Worker Types'] Corporations compete in this dark dystopia, what are you willing to do to win?", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] On June 22nd, 1941, Army Group North, the smallest of the three German army groups, drives forward into the Baltic states.

Their world is ruled by the Prince, the most powerful and influential of the city's Kindred. The Prince's word is inviolate and his actions unquestionable. However, the Prince is dead and his legacy is but ashes. The mantle of leadership must fall upon another Kindred resident of the city - one of the Primogen, the ruling council that normally supports and advises the Prince in his decisions and judgments. The competition will be fierce, and only the most cunning and resourceful Kindred will prevail. Deals will be struck, alliances will be forged, and agreements will be broken. Do you have what it takes to become the new Prince of the City?\n\nThe aim of the game is simple: Score more Prestige than any other player so that you may be declared the new Prince. You gain Prestige by controlling areas of the board that are defined as realms of mortal Influence. Each category is further divided into zones, and some zones are more prestigious than others. Gain even more Prestige by resolving Events that affect the Kindred world, or by implementing various Strategies that give you a unique edge over your opponents. Most troublesome, Prestige can be lost as well as gained - if you are outmaneuvered, you may find yourself becoming Notorious. In the process of building your Prestige, you may acquire Resources or directly Challenge your opponents to hinder them or send them to torpor. You must also keep track of your Blood, which is used up as game turns go by and which you spend to activate Discipline powers. Influence, Resources, Strategy and Blood are the currencies of Kindred unlife, and thus they are all bargaining chips for you to use on the way to ultimate victory.\n\nPrince of the City is designed for three to five players, each of whom represents a different clan from Vampire: The Requiem. Of moderate complexity, the game calls for strategy, tactics, diplomacy and guile to succeed. A number of optional and advanced rules provide even more strategy and replay value for more experienced players.\n\nCreated in the model of the finest European boardgames, the Prince of the City box contains everything you need to play the game, including a full-color board of artwork depicting the city, a rulebook describing how to play, one deck of playing cards (Events, Resources and Strategy), five 10-sided dice, five miniatures and a number of counters and tokens.&quot;", "['Territory Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Set Collection', 'Simulation', 'Tile Placement'] Rival newspaper publishers compete for the perfect front page.", "['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Nautical', 'Pirates'] ['Action \\\\/ Event', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Multiple Maps', 'Role Playing'] Work with your fellow captains to upgrade your ships & take down the Kraken.", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', 'Dice'] ['Dice Rolling'] Flick and push dice down wooden platforms and knock out the competition to win!", "['Civil War', 'Wargame'] ['Chit-Pull System', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] Brigade-Divisional simulation of the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39.", "['Card Game', 'Party Game', 'Word Game'] ['Acting', 'Role Playing', 'Roll \\\\/ Spin and Move', 'Team-Based Game'] Speed charades with a card-munching device.", "['Economic', 'Fantasy'] ['Commodity Speculation', 'Memory', 'Modular Board', 'Open Drafting', 'Set Collection'] Attain mining rights and dig for resources to produce profitable inventions.", "['Bluffing', 'Economic', 'Mafia', 'Negotiation'] ['Deduction', 'Hidden Roles', 'Role Playing', 'Variable Player Powers', 'Voting'] Negotiate, bluff, or muscle your way onto the crew of eight perfect capers.", "['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Science Fiction'] ['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Rock-Paper-Scissors', 'Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Variable Player Powers'] Anticipate your opponent's next move to gain the upper hand in head to head combat.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Ancient'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Modular Board'] Use ancient heroes & warriors to lead the Greeks or Trojans to victory.", "['Age of Reason', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame'] ['Hexagon Grid'] An early morning fog burned off with the dawn, and revealed two long columns of scarlet and blue clad troops. This was His Majesty's Royal Army, commanded by General Sir William Howe. They were marching through the extreme southeastern corner of Pennsylvania and heading toward fledgling America's capital at Philadelphia. Only short weeks earlier this army had disembarked at Head of Elk, Maryland, after a 32-day voyage from New York City aboard the largest armada North America has ever seen. With some 14,000 troops, including crack German mercenaries and elite American Loyalist units, Howe's army was about to execute a flanking maneuver of &quot;Jacksonian&quot; proportions.\n\nGeneral George Washington, holding interior lines at Morristown, New Jersey, was unsure whether Howe would move north in support of the British invasion from Canada (see Saratoga, 1777), or whether he would move south against the Capital. Once the armada set sail, however, Washington shifted southwest and took up a naturally strong defensive position, on high ground behind Brandywine Creek, astride the main road to Philadelphia. Washington posted his troops advantageously and in depth. Control of the fords of the Brandywine would be the key to his position and although a possible flank attack was discussed, it's likelihood was discounted on the strength of local information.\n\nThus the stage was set. Howe, pursuing a strategy of posts, sought European style victory in a sudden taking of the enemy capital. Washington wrote, &quot;Should they push their designs against Philadelphia...they will put the contest on the event of a single battle. If they are overthrown...the war is at an end.

More than 700 British bombers are dispatched to the distant city of NÂÂ&uuml;rnberg. As the bomber stream crawls across the German Reich, it is set upon by swarms of nightfighters. Following the bombers' contrails the figthers infiltrate the stream in great numbers and before the moon can set, they pick off bomber after bomber. The mauled stream makes a desultory attack on the target city, scattering much of their payload of high explosive and incendiaries harmlessly into the surrounding countryside. Then the raid struggles back towards England while fresh formations of nightfighters snap and bite at the retreating formation. More than ninety bombers fail to make it home safely.

RAF 'main force' raids are supported by Mosquito diversions, &quot;Gardening&quot; operations (mining of seaways) and decoy raids. Two card decks--one for each player--are used to resolve the complex interactions of electronic countermeasures and radars, along with other operational factors such as Mahmoud patrols, Flower raids, and Beleuchter illumination units. A detailed bombing resolution system depicts the difficulties of marking targets and area bombing at night.\n\nThere are two scenarios:\n\n1. Berlin covers raiding from the 1943 Hamburg firestorm to the great Battle of Berlin and the RAF's defeat over Nuremburg in March 1944.\n\n2.

The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.\n\nDystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.\n\nWarcradle Studios will supply highly detailed, high-quality miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog-filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.\n\nOur fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall gameplay and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.\n\nDystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.\n\nWe are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat.

Hundreds of miles to the west, two powerful Soviet Fronts are moving west and south against a patchwork German line, intent on destroying the remaining Axis forces in Southern Russia. Operations Star and Gallop have begun.\n\nSix weeks later, the shocked, battered remnants of these two Soviet Fronts are running for the collective lives from powerful German panzer spearheads. What had happened? Soviet overconfidence was responsible in part for the disaster, playing into German hands, but by far, most of the credit for the amazing reversal belonged to Field Marshal von Manstein. Holding off the Soviets to his front and Hitler at his back, he managed to accumulate sufficient panzer formations to allow the Germans to regain tactical and operational superiority.\n\nVon Manstein's Backhand Blow is a low/intermediate complexity two player game using the well-received Turning the Tables system pioneered in earlier east front games produced by Moments in History. The game system itself is easy to learn and master. No two games will ever play out alike because a great deal of uncertainty and randomness is injected into each combat due to the Combat Chit Draw and Random Events Table. This uncertainty makes Von Manstein's Backhand Blow ideal as a solitaire game since combat results cannot be accurately predicted.\n\nDirk Blennemann, the designer, has the reputation for creating excellent Orders of Battle for East Front simulations. Using detailed Russian and German language sources, he provides a broad array of maneuver units - Soviet division and corps on one side, and German units ranging from regiments down to the multitude of ad hoc German kampfgruppen thrown into the battle to stop the Soviet advance.\n\nGame Features:\nTIME SCALE     2 days per turn\nMAP SCALE     8km per hex\nUNIT SCALE     Soviet corps and divisions; German regiments, kampgruppen, and battalion-sized\nNUMBER OF PLAYERS     One or two\n\n(from GMT website)", "['Card Game'] ['Automatic Resource Growth', 'Contracts', 'End Game Bonuses', 'Income', 'Map Addition', 'Movement Points'] Compete to build the galaxy as interstellar architects.", "['Dice'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil'] Get bigger then smaller as you group and select dice in this follow up to Qwixx.", "['Word Game'] ['Spelling', 'Tile Placement'] Supersized Scrabble is the best Scrabble!", "['Dice', 'Science Fiction'] ['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game', 'Variable Set-up'] Members of an alien crew compete to reach the last escape pod.", "['Card Game'] ['Events', 'Trick-taking', 'Variable Player Powers'] Avoid marriage proposals in this trick-taking game based on Hearts.", "['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Humor'] ['Hand Management', 'Player Elimination'] Kung Fu Fighting is a card game that simulates an all-out brawl between 2-6 kung fu masters!

And there are copyists, who will dispute the glory you've earned for your monuments...\n\nThe game shows monument cards with 12 types of ancient monuments like the Pyramids or the Colosseum (9 per type). The game is played in turns and usually you take a &quot;monument turn,&quot; consisting of 3 actions allowing you to collect cards, to build monuments, and to expand your existing monuments. For example, it takes you one action per card to draw it either from the draw pile or the 3 faceup cards near it.\n\nIf you have some cards showing the same monument, you can use another action to erect this monument in your display. In case you are the first one to build this type of monument, you only need two cards - the second player building this same type of monument must have at least 3 cards. And no third player is allowed to build the same monument! Thus, playing your cards early makes it easier for you to erect the monument. But it saves you actions to collect some cards before displaying it, because regardless of the number of cards used, erecting one monument only counts as one single action.\n\nYour monuments will receive their eternal fame only, if they are part of history. Each player has 2 (in a 3 player game: 3) historian tokens. In a historian turn, you have no monument action, but only write a history about all of your OPPONENTS' monuments (not your own ones!). Monuments get famous, and the owners receive victory points at the end of the game - the more often your monuments are in such histories, the more points you get. However, only interesting monuments of at least two cards are considered for a history, and by writing a history, the historian takes one card away (removes it from the game)! Thus the monument could be cut down to only one card during the game and will be not interesting to later historians any more. Why should I write a history and make the monuments of my opponents more worthy? If you do not use all of your historian tokens, you will be punished with 12 negative points at the end of the game! And you get additional victory points in the case that you write histories with a lot of monuments mentioned in it.\n\nYou should make your monuments interesting to historians again. During a monument turn, you may use one action (regardless of the number of cards played at the same time) to add cards to a monument that you have already erected.\n\nIn MONUMENTS, timing is important, and you have to decide what the best move to do now is: Should I wait for another Petra card, or shall I display the Petra Monument this turn? Is it advisable to make a historian turn now or is it better to choose a monument turn and draw the faceup cards, which I really need - taking the risk that I cannot write a history next turn and wind up getting negative points!\n\nFinally, you have to consider that you are not sure about the victory points for your monuments. The points are related to the monument during the game, and if the Akropolis monument is worth 12 Points for example, you will only get 4 points if another player manages to erect an Akropolis monument that is greater than yours. This damn copyist will not only receive all your bad wishes, but 8 of the 12 Akropolis Victory Points - even in the case that his monument was not part of any history.

From that small beginning, the Empire ruthlessly expanded, enslaving or exiling all races that were a threat to their dominion. Recently, the Empire has suffered revolts from conquered races, and on the barren galactic rim, the exiled races gather their forces to strike at the weakened Empire. As the Empire's might and influence wane, a new era is dawning. Which new race will ascend to power?\n\nOmega Centauri is a game of galactic empire building for 2 to 4 players. The play map is made up of sector tiles, and at the beginning of the game the majority of the map is Empire-controlled resource sectors. A variety of map layouts are included and the size of the map depends on the number of players. During each round of play, you have the opportunity to perform three of five possible actions:\n\n\n     Assemble (place your fleets into sectors with shipyards)\n     Build (build monuments, construct shipyards, and erect planetary defenses)\n     Move (move fleets into a sector or out of a sector)\n     Politics (gain resources or increase your fleet capacity)\n     Research (select an available technology)\n\n\nIn the base game, players take turns each round selecting and executing one action at a time until each player has taken three actions, then a new round begins. The base game offers a compelling mix of strategic planning and tactical play, as players must balance their long term goals for development and for technology acquisition with the need to take advantage of the opportunities that arise during action selection.  The base game provides a streamlined 4x experience that can be completed in about an hour.\n\nThe advanced game differs from the base game in several important respects. First, the advanced game introduces improved technologies, racial powers, and other elements to provide a more complex and flavorful gaming experience. It also requires players to select all three of their actions (and the order that they will be performed in) at the start of every round. Thus, to succeed, you must carefully plan your turn, anticipate your opponents' actions, and more successfully execute your overall strategy. Reserve Fleet Actions are added, giving an important boost and a use for spare fleets, through these (and spending valuable resources) players can take an extra action. Finally, through the Politics Action, the full game allows players to select goals that award victory points at the end of the game based upon how well the player has carried out a specific agenda. The full game provides an epic 4x experience in around two hours with variable powers, advanced technologies, and numerous paths to victory.\n\nThroughout the game, you will be compelled to make important decisions regarding how to advance your civilization: Will you focus on obtaining technological or cultural superiority, or will you build an invincible armada to crush those who stand in your way? The winner of the game will be the player who has accumulated the most victory points at the end of the final round of play. Omega Centauri offers players many routes to victory, and you can accumulate victory points (VPs) by wresting control of sectors of space from the Empire (or from other players), by improving your infrastructure and planetary defenses, or by expanding your cultural influence. The player with the most VPs at the end of the final round is deemed to have ascended and established the new dominant Empire in the galaxy.", "['Civilization', 'Science Fiction', 'Space Exploration'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building'] The Galaxy is vast, rich and open to any species who discovers space flight... but nine Elder Races are expanding through space, ready to assimilate or exterminate anybody who stands in their way.\n\nWe are proud to announce Master of the Galaxy, a fast playing 4Ð¥ board game - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate - using a unique and innovative blend of bag-building, card-drafting and tech-tree development mechanisms.\n\nDrawing inspiration from classic science-fiction, movies, and computer games, Master of the Galaxy merges all these inspirations into a unique and colorful setting.\n\nAt the start of your conquest of the Galaxy, you have one star system, one Race card and a modest supply of resources.

The system&rsquo;s designer, Eric Lee Smith, originated the &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; activation system in his game &ldquo;Panzer Command&rdquo; and later used it in &ldquo;Across Five Aprils,&rdquo; Battle Hymn&rsquo;s forerunner, both published by Victory Games. Units are organized by command, usually divisions, and activate for movement when the command&rsquo;s activation marker is picked from the cup. The system uses traditional mechanics for movement, with units differentiated by type, but adds a level of detail to combat that feels almost miniatures like. In fact, the system is designed for easy conversion to miniatures. When one side has the initiative they decide when their combat phase occurs, without it, you don&rsquo;t know when it will happen.\n\nUnits have strength point steps, which are either &ldquo;formed&rdquo; or demoralized, and losses are taken point by point. Based upon the latest research into Civil War combat and tactics, units suffer attrition in both losses and demoralizations until they finally shatter and are removed from the map. There are two combat phases, each of which consists of two rounds of combat. Engagements are fluid, with retreats and advances setting up unexpected confrontations during the second round of combat.\n\nBattle Hymn is a &ldquo;player&rsquo;s game&rdquo; designed to play fast and provide lots of fun and historical insight. With scenarios taking as little as an hour, up to eight hours for the full campaign, there is plenty of variety. The system is streamlined and does not have the complications seen in other games, such as logistics and leadership hierarchy. Here, it's all about strategy, movement, and fighting.\n\nGettysburg: The Tide Turns needs no introduction as to subject, but the treatment is noteworthy. Using a graphics approach based upon the maps produced by the US Government after the war, the map is a pleasure to behold. There are six scenarios in the game, some of which have alternatives for additional variety.\n\nPea Ridge: The Struggle for Missouri simulates the decisive battle of Pea Ridge, which determined that Missouri would stay in the Union. It could have gone the other way. This is a classic meeting engagement with the Confederates on the offensive and outnumbering the Union for once.\n\nOptional rules include hidden movement and more randomization during combat (more historical and also simulates async computer play).\n\nSCENARIOS\n\nNote: Some scenarios have alternatives making them in effect two or more scenarios.\n\nGettysburg\n\nPickett&rsquo;s Charge - 3 turns, 45 minutes\nThe Best Three Hours (Devil&rsquo;s Den) - 3 turns, 1 hour\nThe Accidental Battle (Day One) - 11 turns, 3 hours\nLongstreet&rsquo;s March (Day Two) - 9 turns, 3 hours\nThe Tide Turns (Day Three) - 7 turns, 3 hours\nThe Battle of Gettysburg (campaign) - 31 turns, 8 hours\n\nPea Ridge\n\nThe Surprise Attack (Day One) - 9 turns, 2 hours\nMissouri Redeemed!

If you have no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider, you must use one from your reserve. Notice that purple fruits count as 5 movement points.\n\nThen you take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; that you just used, and put it beside yourself face-up. This is your &lsquo;reserve&rsquo;. If you had no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath your sugar glider and had to use a tile from your reserve, discard this tile to the game case; it cannot be used again for the rest of the game.\n\nThe tile on which your sugar glider has landed (if any) is your new &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo;.\n\nExceptions:\n\n- The sugar gliders cannot jump outside the tree.\n- A sugar glider sitting in the center space can jump to any space on the board by spending any tile from his reserve (no need to match the length of the jump).\n- A sugar glider cannot move through another sugar glider.\n\nExample: Anna wishes to make her sugar glider jump, but there is no &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; underneath her sugar glider. She uses a &lsquo;2&rsquo; from her reserve, moves the sugar glider 2 spaces in a straight line, and discards the tile she&rsquo;s used to the case.\n\nTORPOR\n\nYou don&rsquo;t move your sugar glider. Take the &lsquo;jumping tile&rsquo; from underneath your sugar glider (if there is one), and add it to your reserve.\n\nGAME END\n\nThe game ends when all the sugar gliders are consecutively in a state of torpor, or when the tree runs out of tiles, whichever happens first.\n\nEach player sums the values of the tiles in his reserve (purple tiles count as 5 points).

The Marne was the climactic battle of Germany's attempt to defeat France in the war's first six weeks. Arguably a tactical draw, it was a strategic defeat for the Germans as their armies recoiled from the gates of Paris.\n\nDesigned by eight-time Charles S. Roberts award winner Ted S. Raicer (whose most recent game was GMT's Paths of Glory), and developed by Krieg designer Steve Kosakowski, the Clash of Giants system is intended to emphasize playability while still providing players with proper historical feel. The games focus on the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll.\n\nClash of Giants includes the standard and exclusive rules (including rules for Paris Taxis at the Marne and Geman wireless intercepts at Tannenberg), two full size large-hex maps, two player aid cards, and 264 large counters. Units are divisions and brigades.\n\nSimple but not simplistic, Clash of Giants has a unique combat system based more on a unit's training, equipment, and morale than numbers. In Tannenberg, the victory conditions force both sides to take risks - and the German player will have to use every advantage to avoid being crushed by superior Russian numbers. At the Marne, the Allied player will first have to successfully disengage and rally his French and British armies, before turning to deliver a powerful counterattack.

Developed by the same designer team of the awarded War of the Ring board game (Francesco Nepitello, Marco Maggi and Roberto Di Meglio), The Battle of Five Armies is based on the mechanics first used in that game, merging action dice and event cards.

Build armies of plastic warriors drawn from the many warring factions that inhabit the Mortal Realms, paint your models to personalise your collection, and take them to the tabletop to play fast-paced games of strategy and action that will allow you to tell your own stories within the Age of Sigmar.\n\nThe new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar features the most comprehensive look at the core rules since the first Generals Handbook, and like those changes, the new ones will have an equally huge impact on the tabletop.\n\nArtefacts of the Realms\nThe Mortal Realms are enormous, and the factions that fight among them are characterised as much by which of the realms they hail from as by their Grand Alliance. Previously, we&rsquo;ve seen this represented largely through creative paint jobs and appropriate basing, with some hobbyists using clever conversions to identify where their force comes from. Now, in the new edition, you&rsquo;ll be able to represent where your army hails from with 84 new magic items. When you&rsquo;re writing your army list, you have the option to pick a Realm for your army to be from. As well as providing you with loads of opportunities for roleplaying (not to mention painting and converting), you&rsquo;ll be able to replace one of your normal Artefact picks with a special artefact from your chosen realm.\n\nBattling in the Realms\nThe new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar turns the Mortal Realms into rich backdrops for all of your battles. These aren&rsquo;t just optional expansions, but a core part of the game. Each of the Mortal Realms has a set of unique rules that create unusual challenges and opportunities for the armies fighting in them. Firstly, each realm has a command ability, apart from Shyish, which has two, and Ghur, which has wandering, feral monsters instead. Available to every Hero fighting in that realm, these abilities ensure that your army fights in a thematically appropriate way for the realm it&rsquo;s in. Secondly, each Realm has a set of Realmscape Features &ndash; a random in-game effect that&rsquo;ll often have a significant impact on how your game will go. Last, but not least, each of the Mortal Realms has a massive selection of spells associated with it, representing the unique powers that Wizards are able to harness. Each realm has seven spells, ALL of which will be available to ANY Wizard fighting in that realm. Finally, choosing a Realm has a range of impacts on certain warscrolls. Each endless spell, for example, is more powerful when cast in its associated realm.\n\nCommand Abilities and Command Points\nThere are loads of awesome command abilities in Warhammer Age of Sigmar, but in the previous edition, some would almost never see play because they belonged to models who weren&rsquo;t being used as generals. In the new edition, every Hero can contribute and use their command ability, whether they&rsquo;re your general or not. There&rsquo;s a twist, however &ndash; to use any of your command abilities, you&rsquo;ll need a new resource, known as command points. Command points represent the tactical cohesion of your forces &ndash; you&rsquo;ll receive one to add to your pool every turn, and you&rsquo;ll get an additional point at the beginning of the game per warscroll battalion you&rsquo;ve used. That&rsquo;s not all! There are now three command abilities every single army and every single general can use &ndash; a tweaked Inspiring Presence, At the Double and Forward to Victory.\n\nEndless Spells\nMagic is changing in the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, offering you something never seen on our tables before &ndash; physical sorceries with models and rules of their own. Endless spells are cast like normal spells, but rather than resolving their text with a mere roll of the dice, each summons a model to the table. This miniature then persists throughout the game until it&rsquo;s dispelled. Endless spells are moved at the start of each battle round after determining who gets the first turn, with players taking it in turns to pick a spell to move, starting with the player that has the second turn that round. You&rsquo;ll be able to move any Endless Spell with this move, not just the ones you control, representing their wild and untameable nature.\n\nLook Out, Sir!\nWith the new command ability system making Heroes more useful than ever, the last thing you want is to watch a critical support character get shot off the table before they get to do anything interesting. In the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, we&rsquo;ve balanced this with a new ability for Heroes that&rsquo;ll make your smaller and more vulnerable characters a lot more durable at range. By keeping your heroes close to your units, you&rsquo;ll make them much harder for enemies to kill at range.\n\nMagic: Casting and Unbinding\nMagic is most interesting when each army&rsquo;s magic phase is distinct and defined by the unique character of the wizards involved. To do that, the new edition sees a change to two classic spells &ndash; Arcane Bolt and Mystic Shield &ndash; to offer more incentive to use the unique spells each Wizard has access to. You&rsquo;ll still find these spells a valuable part of any wizard&rsquo;s toolkit, but they&rsquo;ve been toned down in comparison to others. Secondly, you can now attempt to unbind a spell at a massive 30&Prime; range, up from 18&Prime;, making unbinding much easier and also giving you a chance to deny your enemy key spells even in the first turn of the game, where you may not have had a chance to move your wizards into defensive positions.\n\nMeasuring and Piling In\nWe know most people play Warhammer Age of Sigmar measuring from bases already, so this is just a case of enshrining it in rules and making way for a more tactical era of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Piling in has changed to work with the new, official base-to-base system, to allow you to get as many models into combat as possible. Where previously, you could only pile in towards the closest enemy model before having to stop, now, you can pile in even if you&rsquo;re right next to someone &ndash; provided you don&rsquo;t move any further away from the nearest enemy model. This should make large units a bit easier to use and should make surrounding enemies a bit simpler. Secondly, you can&rsquo;t choose not to attack with a unit anymore &ndash; the combat phase only ends when every single eligible unit has piled in and participated.\n\nShooting in Combat\nShooting in the new edition is changing slightly. While you&rsquo;ll still be able to shoot whilst in combat, you won&rsquo;t be able to shoot out of it. This makes for a more dynamic game as far as shooting is involved. Taking a few fast-moving, durable units in your army will be key for quickly occupying shooting units that&rsquo;d usually play havoc with the squishier elements of your forces, while defensively, you&rsquo;ll want to screen your key ranged troops with support troops.\n\nSummoning, For Free!\nIn the new edition, summoning has been changed to work better for everyone and to properly reflect the unique character of each army that uses it. Rather than summoning units through magical spells, every army that could summon units before now has a unique resource that allows them to bring fresh reinforcements onto the tabletop that fits with their army&rsquo;s background. The big change for matched play, though, is that summoning now no longer costs reinforcement points! Instead, you earn your summoned units with in-game actions: bloodshed, spreading plague, mastering magic, and other thematic goals.\n\nTurn Priority\nIn Warhammer Age of Sigmar, the game is split into battle rounds, and players roll at the beginning of each round to see who goes first. This means, in effect, a player may occasionally get to take two turns in a row. In the new edition, the studio have added an extra level of depth, choice and chance to this mechanic, as well as removing some of the randomness, to make for more tactical games. Previously, players would roll off to determine who gets to decide who gets the first turn in each battle round, with the winner getting to choose. This works in much the same way in the new edition, but now, if the players get a draw, the player that went first in the previous battle round wins the roll.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "['Economic', 'Negotiation', 'Real-time', 'Science Fiction', 'Transportation'] ['Action Timer', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Set Collection', 'Simultaneous Action Selection'] Here, where space is endless and time is precious, you face the challenges of a true space commander.

It is a game of massed daylight air battles where players command squadron and flight-sized units in formations of wing strength or greater. One side takes the role of raiders, leading a force of bombers through to the target. The other side defends with fighters, trying to claw for altitude and intercept the enemy.\n\nThe game employs a side-view of the air battle, in which the forces maneuver vertically and end-to-end along the path of the raid. Players must gain height, exploit the Sun and cloud for advantage, and mass or divide their formations to stop the enemy. If you fail, the enemy bombers will rain down bombs on men and ships below.

King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.\n\n\n \n\n    First Newbury 1643: Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry. Essex&rsquo;s stand on Round Hill stopped the Royalist and saved the rebellion.\n\n\n \n\n    Cheriton 1644: Sir William Waller&rsquo;s Southern and Western Association Armies with the help of the London Trained Bands defeated Hopton&rsquo;s Royalists in the rolling hills and hedges. The first in a series of victories in early to mid-1644 the signaled a turning tide in the war.\n\n\n \n\n    Cropredy Bridge 1644: Confident from his victory at Cheriton, Sir William Waller seeks to exploit a gap in the Royalist Main Army on the march. Waller divided his forces and attempted to trap part of the Royalist Army, but difficult terrain and quick reaction by the Royalists turned the tables and left much of Waller&rsquo;s army trapped and he was given a stinging rebuke.\n\n\n \n\n    Marston Moor 1644: The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to affect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arose: Cromwell, a name inextricably linked with the English Civil War and the key player in the following two civil wars.\n\n\n \n\n    Second Newbury 1644: The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.\n\n\n \n\n    Naseby 1645: The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.\n\n\n \n\n    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634: Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated. A strong Swedish force pushed into Bavaria under the joint command of Duke Bernhard and Field Marshal Horn. The Habsburgs effected a union of forces with their Spanish cousins at N&ouml;rdlingen, besieging the Protestant stronghold. The Swedes were drawn into a trap.\n\n\n \n\n    Wittstock 1636: The Cannae of the Thirty Years War. Field Marshal Ban&eacute;r had his lines of communication cut by an Imperial-Saxon army under General Hatzfeld. In a daring plan, Ban&eacute;r divided his numerically inferior force and launched a double envelopment. In a desperate struggle for Vineyard Hill, General Torstensson's cavalry held the line just long enough for General King's cavalry to make the march around the Imperial right flank.\n\n\n \n\n    Second Breitenfeld 1642: Field Marshal Torstensson caps a brilliant campaign with a siege of the Imperial fortress of Leipzig. Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met. The Imperials had hopes for another N&ouml;rdlingen, yet they got another Breitenfeld.\n\n\n \n\n    Jankau 1645: Field Marshal Torstensson launches a surprise winter campaign against the unprepared Imperial forces in Bohemia, catching the Emperor himself virtually unguarded at Prague. With all haste, General Hatzfeld is recalled and an army cobbled together to stop the Swedes. The armies came together in the wooded hill country southeast of Prague.\n\n\n  \nComponents:\n\n    Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series Rulebook\n    &ldquo;This Accursed Civil War&rdquo; Playbook\n    &ldquo;Sweden Fights On&rdquo; Playbook\n    5 Counter Sheets\n    1 Series Marker Sheet\n    4.5 Back Printed Map Sheets (For 11 Battles)\n    6 Two-Sided Battle Specific Player Aid Cards\n    2 11x17 Folded Player Aid Cards\n    1 Orders Summary Card\n\n\n(from GMT website)", "['Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Educational', 'Party Game'] ['Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Set Collection'] ION: A Compound Building Game is a card drafting game where players select from a number of available Ion Cards and Noble Gas cards with the goal of creating sets of compounds and inert noble gases.\n\nHere&rsquo;s how the game is played: Each player is dealt eight cards, must select one of those cards and then passes the remaining.

Elements of fourteen German divisions of the Sixth Army and Fourth Panzer Army engaged dozens of divisions and brigades of the Soviet 62nd Army in one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war.\n\nBattle for Stalingrad uses a game-system of German action and Soviet reaction, highlighting the differences in command and tactics employed by the Germans and Soviets at the time. The Ger-mans enjoyed superior application of their air power and artillery. Their efficient communications and command structure, under General Friedrich von Paulus, allowed them to maintain complete initiative in the battle until they were well into the built-up areas of Stalingrad itself. The Soviets, on the other hand, had poor communications among their forces. Lieutenant-General Vasili Chuikov was hard pressed to maintain com-mand of his army, even in the most critical areas of the city. The campaign was finally decided among the burnt out blocks of the dying metropolis, where the Soviets proved themselves masters of urban combat and the German drive to the East was halted.\n\n1980 SPI Version Components;\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 week\nHex: 656 yards / 600 meters\nUnits: Company to Regiment\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34&quot; full color map\nTwo dual-side printed countersheet (One sheet with 400 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 200 1/2&quot; counters))\nOne 32-page rulebook\nOne 22.25 x 29&quot; Player Aid Sheet (Setup &amp; Reinforcements)\nTwo 6 sided Dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium-High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours\n\n2011 Excalibre Version;\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 1 week\nHex: 656 yards / 600 meters\nUnits: Company to Regiment\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34&quot; full color map\nThree dual-side printed countersheet (two sheets with 280 1/2&quot; counters and one sheet with 40 1/2&quot; counters))\nOne 54-page rulebook\nOne 32-page rules supplement &amp; game analysis booklet\nOne 17 x 20&quot; Deployment Display Chart\nOne 14 x 22&quot; Reinforcement Display Chart\nTwo 6 sided Dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium-High\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 4-15 hours", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Pattern Building'] Place towels in pleasing patterns on the beach.", "['Dice'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Paper-and-Pencil', 'Pattern Building', 'Re-rolling and Locking'] Press your luck with unique dice that have different colors on each face.", "['Card Game', 'Economic'] ['Hand Management', 'Take That'] A 'green' update of Mille Bornes where players race to be the first to earn $250K.", "['Economic', 'Trains'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Network and Route Building', 'Stock Holding', 'Tile Placement'] 1824 Austria-Hungary is a railway building and share dealing game for 3-6 players.

The last time was 1979 when the PRC invaded Vietnam in response to the latter's invasion and occupation of Cambodia. That war lasted about four weeks before China withdrew, having declared its mission accomplished. \n Now, the old foes are at it once again. Sparring over the resource rich areas of the South China Sea, both sides have been slowly edging toward the precipice of war. That day has now come.\n\nNext War: Vietnam is the fifth game in the Next War Series. This game returns the action to Asia and the powderkeg surrounding the South China Sea. This time the Chinese don't intend a limited, punitive expedition; they intend to squash the burgeoning threat from their southern border once and for all and prove, through force of arms, that the South China Sea is theirs. Building on the naval rules showcased Next War: Taiwan, players will have a chance to fight over the Spratly and Paracel Islands once again, as well as the mountainous jungle of North Vietnam. \n If the U.S. gets involved, it might finally land troops in Haiphong Harbor and march on Hanoi, albeit as a relief force and an ally to its former enemy. The question is what will the rest of the region do? Will they join a side or stay neutral?\n Next War: Vietnam will also allow players to play a combined game with Next War:Taiwan, and, with the rules in the latter game, adding on NextWar: Korea as well for what would amount to the Pacific Front of World War III. \n Ownership of any previous Next War Series will NOT be required to play Next War: Vietnam.\n\nUnits: \n Next War: Vietnam primarily represents divisions and brigades of the armies of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (SRV). All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency. The Vietnamese People's Self Defense Force is represented both by units and special rules. \n Air units represent the fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants. They are rated for All-Weather Capabilities, range, average pilot skill and training, and their capabilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions. \n Naval units represent an abstraction of groups of ships (task forces) and allow players to conduct amphibious invasions, naval combat, naval gunfire support, and more. \n Maps and Terrain \n The game&rsquo;s map represents the area in and around the northern border of Vietnam at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from just west of Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam to just east of Nanning, China and just north of the PRC-SRV border to a few miles south of Thanh Hoa, Vietnam. \n The Spratlys, Paracels, and other sea areas are represented by a Strategic Display incorporating Land Areas and At Sea Boxes similar to the one in Next War: Taiwan. \n Game System \n A game turn is composed of:\n\nWeather Determination wherein bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations. \nInitiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.\nSpecial Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. \nStrike Phases in the Advanced Game allow players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes. \nOne or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns. \nArrival of Reinforcements and Replacements \nVictory Determination\n\nCombat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.\n\nScenarios\n\nThere are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives, while at least one will be a campaign game encompassing the entire map. Similarly to previous games in the series, the Advanced Game scenarios will be divided into various starting points representing different levels of build-up before the game begins.\n\nNext War: Vietnam puts you in command of the potential conflict.

At the start of the game, each player receives a number of building blocks and differently-shaped platforms. Each player also receives five bonus points and one pawn, which is placed on the track.\n\nThe game is played in turns with some elements being similar to Burkhardt's own Kupferkessel Co. At the start of his turn, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn forward on the track as many spaces as the number rolled. By expending bonus points, the player may move his pawn further. Then, the player must place one building block on the board in the column or row corresponding to the space on the track where his pawn is located. If he now has the building blocks needed to support one of his platforms, he may place that platform on top of the building blocks. If he does so, he gains an amount of money (Casa Grande Lire) based on the size of the platform and the level at which it was built.\n\nAfter a platform has been added, building blocks may be added on top of the platform. If another player builds on top of your platform, you gain a number of bonus points. You also gain bonus points if your pawn ends its move on a corner (in which you don't get to place a building block).

The air above was suddenly filled with parachutes as thousands of elite German paratroops&mdash;Fallschirmj&auml;ger&mdash;descended from the sky.\n\nThe invasion of Crete was one of the most dramatic battles of the Second World War. Over a nine-day period in May 1941, a mixed force of Commonwealth and Greek troops desperately tried to fight off the German assault. Despite appalling casualties, the paratroopers and glider-borne troops managed to secure a foothold and the critical Maleme Airfield to open the door for the German Gebirgsj&auml;ger (mountain troops) to land under fire. Together the Fallschirmj&auml;ger and Gebirgsj&auml;ger pushed the Commonwealth troops to their breaking point and forced a deadly battle of delay and pursuit.\n\nThis was a true soldier&rsquo;s battle, with both sides in desperate situations often lacking higher-level control and support. The Germans had to quickly secure a usable airfield or face the annihilation of their entire airborne force. The Commonwealth needed to crush the German landings or&mdash;failing that&mdash;evacuate the bulk of its forces to continue the fight in North Africa and Syria.\n\nThe German invasion of Crete in May 1941 stands as a landmark in the history of airborne warfare. Up until that point, airborne operations were tactical operations to seize key objectives in advance of the ground forces. The German invasion of Crete (codenamed Operation Merkur) was the first strategic airborne operation.\n\nAlthough casualties would mean Crete was the last hurrah for the German airborne in a major air assault, it set the stage for even larger future Allied airborne operations in the Mediterranean, Western Europe, and Asia.\n\nOperation Mercury maintains the same level of detail and scale as other Grand Tactical Series (GTS) games. Players command divisions and maneuver company-sized units to fight one of the most desperate battles of the war. Using the GTS 2.0 rules, Operation Mercury offers two players or teams a wide range of scenarios ranging from a single small map with a few units on each side to the full battle including up to two German divisions and several Commonwealth and Greek brigades. Operation Mercury covers all the major airdrops and fighting across the island from Heraklion in the east, through Rethymnon, and from Maleme to Suda Bay then south to the Askifou Plain, scene of the last major fight during the withdrawal.\n\nAs the Commander of Allied forces on Crete, can you deny the Germans a precious airfield and negate their much-needed air-landing reinforcements for a quick victory?

The three different types of workers, each with a different influence value, can be placed on the map of ancient Middle East to gain resources, or can be placed on the corporations to get more workers, or on government and imperial offices. The corporations represent several powers at the court of the Caliph: Intrigue, War, Science, Commerce, and Politics.\n\nThe game takes place over five turns, with turns split into two main phases: the placement phase and the resolution phase. Each phase is split in several rounds. During the placement phase players take turns placing their workers on the board. During the resolution phase they take turns deciding which action will be resolved. Each action, either a zone on the map or a corporation, can hold workers from all of the five players, but only the top three players, identified by influence and placement order will get to resolve the move. During placement workers can be added to the same areas to improve a players's influence. Players with higher influence will get a bigger and better effect out of the action they are resolving.\n\nResolving geographical areas will give a player resources. The resources come in five flavors: Wood, Pottery, Metal, Spice and Silk, and they can be used in trades. The dominating player &ndash; that is, the one with more influence, or in case of a tie, the one who placed first &ndash; will get three different resources, or all of the resources of one type (resources are distributed unevenly on the map), the second player will get two different resources and the third player just one.\n\nThe resources gained by resolving geographical areas can be used in the corporations to buy more workers or get government offices. Government offices work more or less like buildings in other placement games. Some give permanent advantages, some have a one-shot effect, and some can be used every turn. As for the geographical areas, having more influence will be advantageous, and dominating players will get cheaper workers or better effects out of the corporations.\n\nThe game contains no currency, so players will need to be careful when they combine resources to get money because if they pay more than they should, no change will be returned.\n\nEvery turn raiders will spontaneously appear on random locations on the map, so players will need to use some of their actions to hire mercenaries that can be used to combat the raiders and give them access to resources. Players accumulate PPs when they buy offices and workers, and at the end of the fifth turn the player with more PPs is declared the winner.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Medieval'] ['Action Drafting', 'Open Drafting', 'Pattern Building', 'Variable Set-up', 'Victory Points as a Resource'] Japan in the late Middle ages.

The Soviets have successfully entombed the Stalingrad Pocket and are in the process of locking down the pocket even harder.\n\nIn December, 1942. Strong Soviet forces, including the 1st Tank and 5th Mechanized Armies, conducted a concerted attack against German positions in an attempt to block relief efforts directed at Stalingrad from the west. In what is considered a masterpiece of mobile defensive warfare, the German 11th Panzer Division fought a lightning series of &lsquo;fire brigade&rsquo; battles to contain and beat back the efforts of the Soviets to further seal the Stalingrad Area west of the Don Bend.\n\nIn an interesting twist of events, the German 11th Panzer Division, recently arrived from France is preparing to take part in the northern portion of the German relief attempt on Stalingrad (Operation Winter Storm). Full strength and available, the division launches into the Soviet drive in what has become a textbook example of a mobile defense and counter-attack which is studied to this day. It originated the term 'Fire Brigade' as used on the Eastern Front in WW2.\n\nUnder the energetic leadership of Generalmajor Hermann Balck and his Chief of Staff Oberstleutnant von Mellinthin, the 11th Panzer was able to defeat the Soviet mechanized drive.\n\nGerman accounts stop right there, with a German victory. However, the win (if it can be called that) was a Faustian bargain. The Soviet drive was stopped, but at the cost of the German units designated to make the Stalingrad relief effort. There would be no Northern Pincer now. The Southern Pincer soldiered on alone. And failed.\n\nThe game covers all this swirling mobile action in turn representing two to three days and a hex scale of 500 meters.  Units are companies to regiments. Play is highly interactive (the only way to show its mobile nature) using a chit pull system by formation.

Each player has six numbers in different colors in front of them. They can see the numbers of all the other players, but unfortunately, they see only the back of their own display. Who will manage to figure out through deduction what is standing in front of them?\n\nIn more detail, the game includes cards in six colors, with each color having numbers 0-7. One card of each color is randomly removed from play and returned to the box without anyone knowing the numbers on those cards. Each player then sets up a rack with one card of each color on it, but with the racks facing toward the other players so that no one sees the numbers on their own rack. (In a game with two or three players, set up two or one additional racks visible to all players.)\n\nOn a round, the active player rolls the three color dice, e.g., blue, red, and yellow. Each player tries to guess what the sum of the numbers on their rack is for the cards that correspond to the die colors. If the dice showed two green and one grey, for example, you'd add the green number twice and the grey number once &mdash; but of course you can't see what your numbers are; you can only see what they aren't based on what's showing in the racks visible to you.\n\nThe active player then takes one of the bid strips &mdash; seven cardboard strips that come in different lengths &mdash; and places it across one or more numbers on the number line in front of them to show the range in which their sum lies, e.g., 13-16. Each other player does the same, choosing from the strips not previously chosen. If you guess correctly, you score points, with shorter strips being worth more points; if you're wrong, then you must discard any one of your colored cards face up, then draw a new card of this color and place it in your rack unseen. You now see this hidden number, which may help you deduce sums from previous rounds, but now you have to start over with you deductions for that color! Other players see the new card you just placed, so they get more info, too.\n\nAfter 8-10 rounds, depending on the number of players, each player guesses the numbers on their racks, writing down one, two, or three guesses for each color. If you guess correctly, you score 5, 2, or 1 points for a color based on how many guesses you wrote. Add these points to whatever you scored previously, and whoever has the most points wins.", "['Card Game', 'Dice', 'Nautical', 'Territory Building'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting'] Duel to attack and defend colonial forts in the Caribbean.", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] A regiment-level game on the North African campaign in 1940-1942.", "['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Music'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Melding and Splaying', 'Set Collection'] Bid for the hottest blues bands and book your big gig as you compete for mouse tips.", "['Adventure', 'Card Game', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting'] ['Auction \\\\/ Bidding', 'Dice Rolling', 'Player Elimination', 'Push Your Luck', 'Variable Player Powers'] Make extravagant claims for how you will conquer the dungeon, then try to make good.", "['Deduction', 'Spies \\\\/ Secret Agents'] ['Deduction', 'Team-Based Game'] Ask geography questions to work out where the spy is hiding.", "['Card Game', 'Exploration', 'Fighting'] ['Action Points', 'Contracts', 'Cooperative Game'] Explore the blocky landscape together in search of treasure.", "['Space Exploration'] ['Communication Limits', 'Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Real-Time', 'Roles with Asymmetric Information', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game'] Houston, we have a problem!

It draws on the events of the Second Punic War, during which Hannibal crossed the Alps with his elephants, and defeated Rome in the battle of Cannae. The Roman general Scipio succeeded in moving the fighting away from Italy, into Spain and Africa, where he defeated the Carthaginians at Zama.\n\nThe map covers the Western Mediterranean. Players move Legions and Fleets, deciding conflicts by the use of cards in order to determine who will be the dominant power in the Mediterranean region.\n\nImperium (a game for two to five players) focuses on Rome's political and territorial expansion during the Imperial period. Powerful families controlled the individual provinces in order to increase their wealth and power in Rome, until the Roman Empire reached its zenith in size in the year 100 under the Emperor Trajan.\n\nIn each round the two to five players distribute markers onto areas of the Empire, with control of one area being decided each round. The players need to have the right influence at the decisive moment to take control, without neglecting long-term development. It is a game of planning and timing.\n\nCircus Maximus leads us into the heart of Rome itself with its renowned public entertainment for the masses; chariot racing.\n\nChariot races were immensely popular in Rome. The Circus Maximus offered room for 200,000 spectators who avidly followed the races, roaring and cheering on their favourites. The courageous charioteers were divided into teams distinguished by different colours. The most successful were worshipped as heroes, but the risks were high and many paid for their fame and daring with their lives.\n\nEach of two to five players controls a team of three chariots. In a game of pure tactics, players receive five movement cards that they can assign each turn to individual chariots as they wish.

Pirate warehouses are equivalent to settlements in Catan, and the player receive resources from these warehouses whenever a die roll matches the number showing on that island. These resources take the form of equipment cards, and the resources are wood, wool, rum, sabers and gold. With these, players construct ships and more pirate warehouses or buy development cards. Instead of a robber, players must now beware of a Ghost Pirate, which can block the resources normally provided by a warehouse.\n\nEach player starts with two pirate warehouses, and the first player to build seven warehouses wins. In order to build a new warehouse, however, a player must go by ship from an existing warehouse to a new construction site, which thus keeps players alternating between constructing ships and warehouses.\n\nAside from the change in theme, other changes between The Settlers of Catan and Catan: Junior include the elimination of cities (i.e., warehouses can't be upgraded) and the distance rule between settlements, resources allocated by the roll of one die instead of a pair of D6s, and the introduction of a marketplace that allows trading with the bank.

Alices come in five colors, with each player having a set of player boards in these five colors.

If you can, you immediately use the power &mdash; or Megalomania &mdash; of that Alice; if you can't, choose another card or lay an Alice face down as a commoner. Playing a commoner doesn't cost anything, lets you draw another card, and builds up the power of one of your five colors, but you don't get a Megalomania bonus and your turn ends immediately.\n\nIf you played an Alice, you can then invade a territory in the playing area, which is composed of modular hex tiles. To conquer the territory, you need enough military power (red cards) or supplemental military (red) tokens, and if the territory is not on a hex where you occupy a city, you must have enough food (green cards) or food tokens to reach that space. If you conquer it, you receive a bonus based on the territory's color: military, food or dream tokens; Alice cards; or points. If you conquer a city, you score points and now have a foothold on that hex.\n\nIf you lack enough military and food, you can still place the territory under attack and finish it off on a later turn, but another player can potentially conquer it in the meantime.\n\nMystic forests cannot be conquered until they're surrounded by player-controlled territories, and only the player(s) with the most controlled surrounding territories can then capture the forest, which has a toughness and point value equal to the number of surrounding territories.\n\nThe game ends after fourteen rounds, then players score points for having the most or secondmost territories controlled in each hex and for having the most Alices in any of the five colors.

PQ-17 highlights the impact of reconnaissance, fuel, and the extreme climate without the drawbacks of a double-blind system or tedious bookkeeping.\n\nEach of the 1&quot; square ship counters in the game depicts an individual capital ship or cruiser or a group of smaller ships, submarines, or merchant vessels. Virtually every vessel that sailed arctic waters in 1942 is included, along with others that fought (or might have) in key actions. Counters are formatted much like the units in traditional block wargames, allowing step reduction to show damage or reduced numbers without cumbersome markers or rosters. These large counters never appear on the map, however; they remain off-map on players' Task Force Displays until battle is joined.\n\nInstead, players maneuver blocks on a mapboard stretching from Greenland and Ireland to Kiel and the Kara Sea. Each block is a force of submarines or surface ships, its identity hidden from the enemy player until it is located by a successful search and the block is turned up. It may represent one ship or one hundred - or none at all, as it may be a dummy. Reconnaissance is critical, as you must locate the enemy in order to attack him. Cards are used to resolve searches quickly and efficiently: a successful search yields intelligence of varying accuracy, while failure to relocate the enemy in a timely manner results in lost contact and generation of another dummy.\n\nPlayers must also cope with fuel restrictions, reflecting limited endurance (particularly for destroyers) and Axis shortages. Simple rules and the use of markers on the Task Force Displays preclude the need for record keeping while preventing unrealistic freedom of action.\n\nTo show the key role of air power in the campaign, PQ-17 also includes over 100 air units. Circular counters represent RAF Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm squadrons and Luftwaffe Staffeln and Gruppen that participated in naval operations in the theater, as well as selected air defense units. Many VVS air regiments are also included, along with the USAAF squadrons that defended Iceland.\n\nBecause the focus of the game is operational, battles are fought on an abstract Combat Display. Simple procedures and multiple Combat Results Tables reproduce historical levels of damage from all forms of combat: submarine attacks, antisubmarine warfare, bombing and aerial torpedo attacks, anti-aircraft fire, air-to-air combat, and naval surface actions.\n\nPQ-17's environmental model is based upon historical meteorological and oceanographic records to accurately reflect the extreme conditions and their effects. Summer operations, conducted in round-the-clock daylight, play much differently than those undertaken in the near-total darkness of winter. The polar ice pack advances and ebbs with the seasons, varying the sea routes available and posing a hazard for naval forces venturing too close. And besides each other, players must also battle some of the worst weather in the world, potentially damaging their ships and affecting movement, searches, and combat.\n\nPQ-17 features nine historical scenarios, including all the major actions of the campaign: the Fleet Air Arm torpedo attack on Tirpitz, the decimation of convoy PQ-17, the climactic battle of PQ-18, the Battle of the Barents Sea, and the 1943 Battle of North Cape. To add uncertainty, each side is subject to a special condition in every operation, which may impose additional requirements or restrictions - or afford additional opportunities - while remaining secret from the opponent. Just like their historical counterparts, Allied players can never be certain that the Germans will not attempt to break out into the Atlantic with one or more heavy ships, and Axis players must beware of a possible attack on Norway; both players may face conflicting priorities and demands that must be met with limited resources. In addition, a 1942 &quot;random&quot; scenario enhances replay value by further disguising starting forces and objectives. Each operational scenario can be played to conclusion in 3-4 hours, and for players seeking a richer experience, a 1942 campaign scenario reflects the challenges of continuing operations over the course of this key year.", "['Action \\\\/ Dexterity', \"Children's Game\", 'Party Game'] ['Hand Management'] Have the most survivors and you win!", "['Card Game', 'Deduction', 'Fantasy', 'Medieval', 'Party Game'] ['Role Playing', 'Storytelling', 'Targeted Clues', 'Voting'] Sow doubt about your identity while guessing who?s who.", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Area Movement', 'Dice Rolling', 'Movement Points', 'Ratio \\\\/ Combat Results Table', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Simulation'] A fast-playing area-based wargame with great tactics and strategy depth.", "['Age of Reason', 'American Revolutionary War', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Point to Point Movement'] &quot;Supply Lines of the American Revolution: The Northern Theater, 1775-1777&quot; is a two-player game of supply, logistics, and deceit set during the first three years of the American Revolutionary War.

You decide which vehicles and infantry units to use and which commanders are best for the mission. Vehicle and infantry commanders are rated for skill level and even personality quirks such as how well they keep their heads while under fire. Deciding which commanders are used for each mission is a major consideration. Your units will become fatigued with every mission. If you push a commander and his men too hard, his skills will degrade. Your commanders and their crew also gain experience with every mission. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep fighting with your top commanders and crew and further fatigue them to get the job done, or let the new guys fight in order to prep them for the tough missions ahead?\n\nMissions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. Double sided terrain tiles provide everything from cities and farmland to snow covered forests and hills to sand dunes and oases.\n\nDuring combat, you get to resolve every fight with enemy tanks, infantry, anti-tank guns, and squads of infantry. Each enemy tank, truck, infantry, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield. A unique fog of war system adds to the tension of the combat as unless you have a clear line of site to the enemy, you may not know exactly what is coming out of the morning fog towards your tanks until it&rsquo;s too late.\n\nAfter combat, you can rest and refit your vehicles and infantry. As new technology becomes available, you can replace older obsolete tanks with newer and deadlier models such as the Tiger, Panther and even the deadly King Tiger!

New roads have been built in the kingdom, with a new city founded at their meeting point which has grown so much that the King has decided to move the capital there and build a new castle.\n\nNumerous corporations of craftsmen were already present in the city, but now guilds are forming, which are larger and more wide-ranging, powerful and in competition with one another.

There both armies stood to fight the bloodiest single day battle in American history. The final decision is in your hands.\n\nNone but Heroes is a game about that terrible day. Players tackle each other head-on. Can you do better than McClellan? Can you fight McClellan off like Lee? The stakes couldn't be higher!\n\nNone but Heroes is the first game in the new Line of Battle Series. While drawing on the lessons of over 20 years of ACW design work of its two ancestor series, LoB represents the next generation of ACW game design. No stone was left unturned in making this system the best gaming experience possible. All the unit rosters and paperwork that interfered with the fighting is gone. The typical (and time consuming) multiple fire phases have all been integrated into movement so the action is non-stop.\n\nFor the first time, the rat fight feel of the ACW open battlefield comes alive. The historical units (generally regiments of infantry and batteries of cannon) actually show the combined arms interactions and tactics available at the time. Old hands will see the history in a new light as they explore the implications of more recent research.\n\nRepresenting many years of original research, the game contains information not available anywhere else regarding the strength, equipment, location, capabilities, and order of battle of both armies. Extensive historical notes layout just some of the myriad of details included in the units, scenarios, and map.\n\nAs one small example, it explores the frequently overlooked &quot;Green&quot; units at the battle (units which have been in the army for a few weeks or even less). The Green units will make you look at McClellan's strength in a whole new way. This is a level of &quot;greenness&quot; well beyond the usual sense of &quot;not having been in combat, yet&quot;. These are enthusiastic men, but some of whom have not yet been taught to load their muskets.\n\nThe Union player is only mildly inhibited by his McClellan persona; you can try a lot of different approaches to cutting the Rebels down to size. You are equipped with the same heavy guns and infantry with just as much grit and determination as he was.\n\nThe Confederate player will need to use his thin forces wisely, but cannot fail to counterattack as needed to blunt Union advances. You must use your troop's elan to make up for their limited numbers.\n\nThe game features four two-map scenarios which allow players to pick up the action at various times during the day and the morning of the next. The ability to start play the day after the battle allows players a chance to explore the options available on that day. Each of the other three scenarios can alternatively be played as a two day campaign game.\n\nIn addition to the large scenarios above, there are four smaller scenarios involving only portions of one map. One is a very short learning scenario showing the charge of Hood's Texans into the Cornfield. The other three isolate key actions of the battle: The complete Cornfield fight, the Battle for the Sunken Road, and the final attack by Burnside to take Sharpsburg and the counterattack by A.P.

Each of its side shows another symbol. It blocks or frees the tiles to be moved in specific directions, depending on the direction indicated by the uppermost symbol. If a barragoon piece is captured, it can be placed again on the board at a free chosen position. By this, the players can block or attack the opponent or save their own tiles.\n\nThe clou: \nEach time a tile is captured, two new, additional barragoon pieces have to be put on the board. By this, the board becomes more and more crowded and the risk to get locked up increases.

Each player starts the game with a different-colored donkey, then two cards are removed from play and five cards laid out face-up. On a turn, a player must do one of the following three actions:\n\n&bull; Take the lowest valued card on display, with donkeys always being worth less than gold, and add it to his tableau.\n&bull; Exchange one gold card from his tableau for a lower-valued gold card.\n&bull; Exchange a donkey from his tableau for a gold card of any value.\n\nWhenever a player collects three cards of the same color, he must score it. First, though, he can pilfer a card in a color not present in his tableau from an opponent.\n\nWhen the last face-up card is claimed, five new cards are revealed. Once the final set of five cards is claimed, players compare their totals in each of the six colors; whoever has the highest total in a color scores the highest gold card of that color. Players then sum the cards in their score piles, and the player with the highest score wins.", "['Ancient', 'Religious', 'Territory Building'] ['Network and Route Building', 'Worker Placement'] King Solomon reigned over the kingdom of Israel during its golden age. He commanded tribute from Israel&rsquo;s neighbors, expanded Israel&rsquo;s borders, built roads and fortresses, and kept the peace within the land. His merchants filled the kingdom with exotic goods such as spices, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Perhaps most famously, Solomon also built the Temple in Jerusalem, a golden place of worship lasting hundreds of years.\n\nWisdom of Solomon is a 1-5 player worker placement game taking place during the reign of King Solomon. Players act as Governors for Solomon, sending out workers to gather Resources, build structures, and expand Solomon&rsquo;s influence in the kingdom. The player who curries the most Favor will be crowned the winner!\n\nThe Wisdom of Solomon board is divided into two sections. The section on the right side of the board is a map of Solomon&rsquo;s kingdom where players will build custom houses and roads. As a Governor expands their influence in the land with new roads and houses, that Governor&rsquo;s network will become more powerful and pull Resources from more and more areas. These networks of custom houses will control the flow of Resources in Wisdom of Solomon!\n\nOn the left side of the board is a miniaturized version of the city of Jerusalem. Within this city is the Market area, a region of the city where workers will be sent to buy, sell, and trade Resources and also to play powerful Fortune cards that have been acquired. Elsewhere in Jerusalem is a Foreman who has the plans for building new structures throughout Israel. A Governor can use their Resources to build these structures and create new houses of influence in the kingdom, while granting the Governor new ways to gain Resources and Favor.\n\nFinally, within the city of Jerusalem a Governor may visit the Levites to help build the Temple of Solomon. Workers send to the Levites can donate Resources to raise this awesome structure and gain great Favor and Fortune! Next to this Temple are the Holy Places, the most sacred of objects that groups of workers may visit and receive great things!\n\nWisdom of Solomon ends when a Governor no longer has a Custom House to build or the Temple of Solomon has been completed. When that occurs, the round ends and each person reveals their Temple Tokens. Each Governor tallies their final score and the person having the most Favor wins!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "['Arabian', 'Economic'] ['End Game Bonuses', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Open Drafting', 'Square Grid', 'Tile Placement'] Attract customers to your stalls, while trying to box in your competitors.", "[\"Children's Game\", 'Fantasy', 'Memory'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Memory'] Work together to find magic objects and return to wizard school ahead of the ghost.", "['Horror', 'Humor', 'Miniatures'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Team-Based Game', 'Variable Player Powers'] Defeat Doctor Zero in this tactical miniatures game set in a classic 1980s movie.", "['Book', 'Industry \\\\/ Manufacturing', 'Renaissance'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Worker Placement'] Feel the strong interaction.

Perhaps one of the most evenly matched battles of the war, Murfreesboro/Stone&rsquo;s River pitted the Federal Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Starke Rosecrans against the Confederate Army of Tennessee captained by General Braxton Bragg. With near parity of numbers (each side fielded roughly 40,000 men) and remarkably similar battle plans, both armies grappled in the December cold for control of Middle Tennessee.\n\nThe Series:\n\nThe GBACW Series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental Level Gettysburg game - Terrible Swift Sword - created by Richard Berg in 1976. Since then, the series has undergone numerous system evolutions, always seeking to enhance the player&rsquo;s illusion of reality. Today, the series relies on inter-active chit-pull mechanics to simulate the sometimes chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield. GMT's Red Badge Of Courage and Gringo! Are the two most recent releases in this classic line of games.\n\nThe Game:\nDead of Winter II completely revisits this battle. The old version needed a face-lift. The biggest change is in returning the ground scale to 110 yards per hex.  While going to the larger scale means an increase in maps, the added elbow room allows for much more historical unit frontages and more playable stacking.\n One Introductory and ten regular scenarios examine every aspect of the historical battle and present the players with several plausible alternative situations based on events leading up to the actual engagement. Scenario sizes range from one-half of one map and an hour to play, to all four maps and many enjoyable gaming hours. Also included are a number of optional forces that could have plausibly been brought into the fight; Keep your opponent guessing as to what he will face next with this interesting range of options.\n\nThe Team: \nWhile Richard Berg remains the final authority for all things GBACW, and John Alsen continues his invaluable role in the development of each title, Dead of Winter II adds one more well-known gaming name to the mix: Designer Dave Powell. Dave has designed more than a dozen civil war simulation games with The Gamers, Inc, (now owned by MMP.) Dave has always loved the GBACW since the moment he first opened the box for TSS, and welcomed the chance to bring his design talents and historical skills to the Dead of Winter project.\n\nThe GMT game is the revised second version of Dead of Winter: The Battle of Stones River ??Murfreesboro, Tennessee by Simulation Design, Inc..\n\n\nGame Design: Dave Powell\nSeries Design: Richard H.

On your first turn, you place your starting station somewhere on the game board. On each subsequent turn, you place either one or two rails that connect two points on the board; you can place only one rail if you're crossing a river or a mountain ridge with that rail.

Why is that important?\n Because in the Action Phase only the strongest Groups can execute their Classes action. \nThe Planning Spaces are resolved consecutively. First all players reveal their Group in Planning Space 1 and tell the other players the Class they played and the Group Strength (defined by the number of Class icons on the played cards). The strongest Group executes their action and afterwards sends their Leader to the king (this Hero is out of the game) while the remaining Heroes celebrate their success in the Party Tent. \nThey won&rsquo;t be available next round to that player. Weaker Groups keep their Heroes and get a new one as compensation.\n\nAs mentioned before, the Classes execute different Actions in a specific order: Warriors always go first followed by Technicians, Hunters and Cooks. The Cooks convince new Heroes with Special Abilities to join your Faction with their delicious dishes. The Warriors, Technicians and Hunters can take specific Forest Cards while other cards block their way. How the Forest changes over the course of three Expeditions of a round is also something you must anticipate during the Planning Phase. In the Action Phase you cannot change your Groups anymore.\n\nAfter 5 or 6 rounds (depending on the number of players) the player who was able to collect the most experience will be known as &quot;The Boldest&quot;!\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Game System'] [] Compendium of rules for games you can make yourself.", "['Ancient', 'Civilization', 'Economic'] ['Area Movement', 'Campaign \\\\/ Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Defend the Mississippian culture of ancient America in this solitaire game.", "['American Civil War', 'Wargame'] ['Hexagon Grid'] Pea Ridge recreates the battle of the same name during the American Civil War in the West, using the Great Battles of the American Civil War system based on the award-winning, monster game Terrible Swift Sword.\n\nPea Ridge is a meeting engagement of the battle on March 7-8, 1862 between CSA forces under General Earl Van Dorn and the Union troops commanded by General Samuel R.

In late 1940, the Italian Army invaded Egypt beginning the famous North African Campaign of World War II. After a short withdrawal, the Commonwealth forces counterattacked and all but threw the Italians back to Tripoli. Not content to let his southern partner bring disgrace to the Axis arms, Hitler dispatched a German contingent under a new commander: Erwin Rommel. His arrival began a rapid mobile campaign across the rocky sands.  However, by the end of 1942, Rommel had failed in his final bid to seize the Nile Delta and was thrown completely out of the theater by Montgomery's pursuit after El Alamein. Axis fortunes would never rise on the African continent again.\n\nAfrika is a fast paced game of mobile warfare at the operational level. Can you take the Nile?

There&rsquo;s also 122mm artillery for the first time, and Ba64 armored cars.\n\nReturning to the Panzer Grenadier system are the Soviet Guards, the elite of the Soviet armed forces.

The game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles, with the armies in this set particularly focused towards cavalry and ranged combat.\n\nDuring Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn. Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.\n\nThe game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Elves and the Lizardmen. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Elf faction is based around strong cavalry units and archers, but has a relatively weak infantry. The Lizardmen army is the most flexible Lords of War army released so far and is best used to disrupt and counter enemy attack strategies.\n\nElves versus Lizardmen is compatible with Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another.

Germany is faced with mortal enemies on two fronts. She must eliminate one threat, or face being crushed between the two. The German strategist von Schlieffen plans one of the great military gambles of all time. His scheme is to concentrate to knock France out of the war before Russia can fully mobilize. The bulk of German forces will move through neutral Belgium. Graf von Schlieffen intends to fall on the flank of the French armies. He believes the French will over commit to regaining their lost provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. The Schlieffen plan runs into complications from the moment it is launched. The Belgians fight back. The British join the fray. The French display surprising flexibility. Can the invading German armies still defeat France? Or will the French, British, and Belgians stop them? This time, it is up to you.\n\nMay 1915 - Artois\n\nThe immediate threat to France is over. The Germans have re-deployed substantial forces to the Eastern Front. French and British reinforcements arrive in increasingly telling numbers. The French believe the opportunity has come to expel the invaders. Both sides have used the lull since 1914 to dig in. Trench lines stretch from Switzerland to the English Channel. The Germans may be weaker, but they stand inside the most extensive field fortifications the world has yet seen.\nFebruary 1916 - Verdun\n\nThe Germans reduced the Russian threat in 1915. Now the German Field Marshal von Falkenhayn believes he can eliminate France through a battle of attrition. An epic struggle that will sear the bodies and souls of both nations begins. Both sides will feel the effects of losses on a national scale. Yet neither will shrink from the cost of the sacrifice.\n\nJuly 1916 - The Somme\n\nThe new British Army is ready. With German attention focused on Verdun, the British feel they have a chance to break through. An intense, week long bombardment will pulverize the German lines before the attack begins. The British climb over the top and begin to cross no-man's land. The Germans survived the shelling and doggedly defend their line. Bitter fighting will last for months in the valley of the Somme.\nApril 1917 - Nivelle's Offensive\nThe French are now led by General Nivelle, a hero of Verdun. He plans a two pronged attack against the German salient pointing at Paris. He intends for his &quot;Army of the Rupture&quot; to be through German lines in a day. The problem is the Germans also see the potential of his plan. They retreat to the formidable defenses of the Hindenburg Line. Nivelle plows ahead regardless. The soldiers of the French army are rather unhappy with the result.\n\nMarch 1918 - The Great Offensive\n\nThe Russians are out of the war. The Germans now concentrate in France with divisions trained in new assault tactics. The Stosstrupen are aimed at the weak point of depleted British lines. The Germans will have to win before tanks and American troops will tip the scales against them. Can the British and French hold out until a counter-offensive is possible?

This series presents a brigade-level system that highlights ease and speed of play combined with solid historical insight. Glory III follows the success of Glory II: Across the Rappahannock, and presents a polished system with ease of play, with two combat-intensive one-map battles. And it is still a game that can be played, and played well, by solitaire gamers.\n\nGlory III features GMT's unique chit activation mechanic, which provides a great deal of play tension, as the commanders never quite know what is going to happen next. However, new command and combat mechanics make the game even more fun. Both battles have special command problems and some new and interesting mechanics to allow the players to play within the framework of those conditions.\n\nAntietam, one of the major battles of the war, makes great use of the Glory activation system, linking the Union/McClellan command problems directly to its use. But it still allows the player to make choices, choices different from those Little Mac made, perhaps changing the course of the battle.\n\nCedar Creek is a great momentum battle, with an initial, probably highly effective Confederate surprise attack followed by the return of General Phil Sheridan to the battlefield, the arrival of George Custer's repeater-armed cavalry, and, hopefully for the Union Player, enough of a counter-attack to snatch victory from Jubal Early's rapidly munching jaws.

This results in players unsure of when or if a certain field commander will carry out your orders. The game system is designed for playability over bookkeeping. The main rules are only 12 pages long.

These games are based on a new game system that has been designed for solitaire and two-player gaming.\n\nThe object of the game is to break three of the formations of the opposing side.  This is done by activating your formations and choosing the best actions for it to undertake given the state of the battlefield.\n\nShould you fire your artillery or attack with your infantry?  Or should you move your formation to a part of the battlefield that provides an advantage?  Or reinforce a faltering formation with troops from a stronger formation?  Whatever choice you make, there is a cost to the morale of your active formation.\n\nFurther, you are limited by the number of times you can call upon a formation, and once called upon you must decide how long you want it to press the attack.\n\nEach time you call upon a formation your army gains momentum.  As your army builds momentum it allows you to press your formations to continue attacking, but the cost is a reduction in the momentum the army has built up as well as reductions in the morale of the attacking formations.\n\nEach formation has a fixed number of troop markers that can be hit in combat and are also subject to breaking from morale loss.  Each formation can only be activated when its activation card is played, and these are limited and not always available.  Each formation reduces its morale when activated and when continuing attacks.\n\nFormations are broken when they fail a morale test OR when all their troop markers are eliminated.\n\nPlayers decide which formations to activate and how far to push once they begin attacking. Push just enough and they can win the day.  Push too much and a failed morale test will break them.\n\nFreeman's Farm has been designed for easy set up and quick game play.

The game particularly focuses on the fighting of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division in the Jolan District in the north-west part of the city in the morning of November 9th.\n\nThe player controls USMC troops while the system handles the insurgents. This design is based mainly on the article &quot;Infantry Squad Tactics: Some of the lessons learned during MOUT (military operations in urbanized terrain) in the battle for Fallujah&quot;, published in the September 2005 issue  of the Marine Corps Gazette.\n\nThe map includes a part of the Jolan District, divided into 61 zones of approximately 50x50 meters and sections of road of equal size. Each zone is made-up of several locations (open ground, courtyard, first storey, second storey, rooftop) represented by boxes that are used to manage movement. Tracks and charts are also on the map edges.\n\nThe troops of each side are represented by &lsquo;unit&rsquo; counters, each corresponding to one Marine squad (six to 12 men) or a group of insurgents (about six men each). The total strength of USMC forces is about that of a reinforced company. Each squad has a combat factor that is used to resolve firing and assaults. The attachment of a Combined Anti-Armor Team (CAAT) to a squad increases its combat factor in certain cases. When a USMC squad suffers a step loss during combat, the counter is flipped to its reduced side. If it suffers another loss, the unit is removed from the game (i.e., the squad is no longer operational and the wounded are evacuated to the rear). Insurgent units appear in two distinct types: guerrilla units and martyr units, also each with their own combat factors. Guerrilla units fight USMC troops but withdraw rather than be destroyed. Martyr units, instead, have vowed to die where they stand and kill as many enemies as possible. These units are immobile and, within their fortified positions, await the attacks of USMC forces. At all times, insurgent units are eliminated after suffering one step loss.\n\nInsurgent units do not appear directly on the map. Initially, the player deploys &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers which represent a potential, non-identified danger to USMC troops. Their placement is partially random. Once fired upon or assaulted, these &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; markers are activated and their true nature (dummy, guerrilla, martyr, IED, or sniper) is revealed. However, USMC troops can also count on the support and fire power of a pair of M1A2 Abrams tanks. A section of Iraqi soldiers from the Iraqi Intervention Force (IIF) is also available, their mission being the capture of the mosque in Jolan, as the USMC troops do not have the right to enter that zone.\n\nThe game lasts a maximum of 16 turns, each representing about 15 minutes of real time. Each turn begins with a variable cycle of USMC support missions. These missions are of three types (reconnaissance by drones &ndash; UAV, close air support by helicopter, and aerial bombardment). Each of these missions can only be conducted a certain amount of times per game, and their execution is not automatic. In case of a mission being cancelled or delayed, the insurgents can temporarily take the initiative and act (reinforcements, withdrawal, counter-attack, etc.). Then, a reinforcement phase allows the player to enter extra troops onto the map at the cost of victory points. Each squad then has the opportunity to fire or move. After conducting movement, the player resolves his assaults against insurgent units that are adjacent to his Marines. Before launching an assault, a squad can detach its security element in order to isolate the zone and prevent any retreat by the enemy. There are three types of assaults in the game, depending on the locations occupied by the belligerents: &lsquo;top-down&rsquo;, &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo;, and normal. Each type has their advantages and disadvantages for the attacker and defender. CAAT support can also use their incendiary explosives to eliminate insurgents that are too strongly entrenched. Also, each assault can be accompanied by a random event which will influence its result. The game turn concludes with a re-organization phase during which the USMC capture of zones and the infiltration by insurgent troops is checked.\n\nAt the end of the 16 turns, the player determines his victory level. If all of the zones on the map are not controlled by the USMC, the player loses the game. If at the end of any turn the USMC controls every zone, the player wins the game and calculates his victory points to determine the extent of his victory (major, minor, bitter). A full game can be completed in about four hours.\n\nComponents:\n\n&bull; 17x22 map\n\n&bull; 88 &frac12;&rsquo;&rsquo; die-cut counters and 140 5/8&rsquo;&rsquo; counters\n\n&bull;  1 player aid\n\n&bull; 1 die\n\n&bull; Rule booklet", "['Dice', 'Puzzle'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Enclosure', 'Line Drawing', 'Paper-and-Pencil'] In Bukiet, players grow flowers on their personal sheets.

Beginning with Chandragupta Maurya&rsquo;s victories over the Nanda clan, the game follows the brief but rapid rise of the Mauryan dynasty, from Chandragupta&rsquo;s expulsion of Seleucus from the Indus river valley to the conquest of the last independent kingdom on the subcontinent, Kalinga, by his grandson Ashoka.  The Mauryan empire became the largest and most powerful in India&rsquo;s history &ndash; a distinction that would remain unchallenged until the arrival of the Mughals some 1,700 years later.\n\nChandragupta simulates the traditional &ldquo;four-fold&rdquo; division of the Indian military system, with the elephant corps reigning supreme, and the hordes of light infantry regarded as little more than fodder for chariots&rsquo; wheels and trampling pachyderms.  Chariots still play a prominent role on the Indian battlefield of the era, but the cavalry, with its versatility and endurance, is a potent competitor.  In Chandragupta, victory goes to the commander who can master the unique aspects of the differing Indian military &ldquo;classes&rdquo; &ndash; the professional, lifelong soldiers called Maulas, the mercenary levies, unpredictable tribal allies, and the militias of the powerful trade guilds.  While Maulas and mercenaries are commanded under a single hierarchical command structure, the tribals and the trade guilds are led by independent chiefs.\n\nUnits include cataphracted elephants, &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; four- (and sometimes eight-!) wheeled chariots, and even an &ldquo;elCH&rdquo; unit &ndash; yes, elephant-pulled chariots.  Rules include Combined Chariot/Infantry and Elephant/Infantry lines, Dharmayudda or &ldquo;just&rdquo; warfare, Guild enmity, and Tribal loyalty.  EL units can even breach camp walls and pull down city gates (if they don&rsquo;t rampage first).\n\nFans of GBoH will appreciate the exciting variety in Chandragupta&rsquo;s scenarios, from huge set-piece battles on flat plains, to tribal suppressions, a night assault on a military camp, and street fighting in the city of Takshashila.

The player who did that will get the profits from the buildings placed there and, more importantly, will block the possibility of activating this part of the city for the other players.

Each player's aim is to have their mansion worth the most fear points when the Freak Shop closes, with points coming from a combination of three randomly chosen objectives.

Raicer&rsquo;s popular and critically acclaimed Clash of Giants WWI series to two of the storied battles of the American Civil War: Second Bull Run and Gettysburg. CoG: Civil War uses a modified version of the chit-pull Activation system of Clash of Giants II: Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914, while retaining the CoG combat system. Every (mostly brigade-level) unit has a Tactical Efficiency Rating based on its morale, training, leadership, and experience, but even a poor unit can have a heroic moment, while the Iron Brigade might not always be made of iron. It is a true player&rsquo;s system, which produces realistic results without a lot of fiddly procedures, and allows players to concentrate on the game rather than the rules.\n Units in CoG: Civil War are mostly infantry brigades, (with the odd cavalry brigade or demi-brigade).  Each day is divided into four day turns and one night turn. The maps depict woods, hills, steep hexsides, railway cuts and embankments, roads, rivers, creeks, bridges, towns, marshy ground, and the Devil&rsquo;s Den at Gettysburg.\n The Activation rules, which combines random formation activation (mostly corps for the Union and divisions for the Confederates) with variable movement allowances, creates the fog of war and friction so important to Civil War battles. Ordering your corps commander to take a hill is one thing-getting him to act as you wish is another. And because these effects are achieved without hidden counter/dummy unit mechanics, CoG: Civil War is not only a fast-paced two-player game, but excellent as well for solo play.  Some Activation markers also allow you to coordinate more than one formation, such as Longstreet at Gettysburg. But don&rsquo;t expect Old Pete to do so early in the day!\n\nOne thing that speeds play in CoG: Civil War is the unusual treatment of artillery. There are no artillery units depicted; instead artillery appears as Combat Support Markers which are added (attacker first) to the combat strength of engaged units. Artillery CSMs are generally assigned to a specific division or corps, though army reserve artillery can be used to support any units. Artillery cannot be used in combat in certain terrain (woods or town hexes), but there are no line of sight considerations to slow down play or complicate the rules. Instead both line of sight and enemy counter-battery fire are handled with an elegant abstraction: each turn all available artillery CSMs of both sides go into a cup, and then half are randomly drawn. Whatever comes out of the cup is available for use that turn, so the player with more artillery on the field is more likely to get artillery support. This also allows a simple way to model the effectiveness of the Union Artillery Reserve at Gettysburg; once arrived, these markers never go in the cup, and are always available for use. Overall, CoG: Civil War&rsquo;s portrait of artillery as an occasionally decisive but definitely secondary arm is arguabley more realistic than many more complicated designs.\n The two battles, Second Bull Run and Gettysburg, depict one of Lee&rsquo;s greatest victories, prior to his first invasion of the north, and his greatest defeat during his second invasion. Both are meeting engagements, with limited forces deployed at the start, gradually building to mighty clashes. The arrival of fresh forces is another area where the game system allows variability: units may be delayed or arrive at the wrong road. You can even attempt to speed the arrival of your off-board forces, but at increased risk of their arriving later instead.\n\n\nWinning involves a combination of taking and holding victory hexes, exiting units, and inflicting casualties. You can also earn victory points to compensate for units whose arrival is delayed-but only if you didn&rsquo;t try to force march them to an earlier arrival!  Players will have to judge trading losses for taking or holding tactically important ground.\n\n\nSpecial rules cover such things as General Pope&rsquo;s confused and confusing orders at Second Bull Run, the Confederate grand battery on the third day at Gettysburg, the use of the Union VI Corps as a reserve in both battles, cavalry delaying actions and retreat before combat, rallying units at night, and the actions of certain key leaders. But though there is enough chrome to give each battle a distinctive flavor, the action remains uncluttered, quick-playing, and  exciting.\n Not simply &ldquo;another Civil War battle system,&rdquo; CoG: Civil War presents a fresh new look at an oft-game topic. Giving each side a chance to change history in an afternoon&rsquo;s gaming, the use of the Clash of Giants system also shows the sometimes surprising links between the battles of the Civil War and the opening battles of the Great War 50 years later.

One major difference in Second Edition was the addition of a cost system to equipment, events, personnel, and ships. A card's cost is listed in the top left-hand corner of a card, directly preceding the card's title as a single digit number (currently anywhere from 0 to 9). A player receives seven 'counters' at the beginning of each turn; to play a card, the player must spend a number of counters equal to the cost of the card. Only interrupts (of the card types in a player's deck) do not have a cost and are treated as 0-cost.Another major change in the gameplay of Second Edition was the new method of handling dilemmas. Instead of using First Edition's lengthy procedure of a 'seed phase', which could last upwards of 15 minutes, Second Edition employs an 'on-the-fly' method for constructing dilemma combinations. While First Edition attempted to sometimes literally represent instances from the Star Trek universe in the game, Second Edition has focused more on a consistency of gameplay as a priority over design consideration with regard to remaining faithful to the source material. Effects on cards sometimes lack the &quot;Trek sense&quot; that First Edition cards contained and can be purely conceptual, but are generally much more equitable when compared with other similarly costed effects.", "['Real-time'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling'] You have 20 minutes to work together and save the city.

The offensive soon faltered. In December, General O'Connor led the outnumbered Allies in a counter-attack that crushed the 10th Army and threw the remnants out of Cyrenaica. So began two years of fluid, seesaw operations waged by Axis and Allies at the edge of the desert on the rim of Africa.\n\nWestern Desert, Europa VI, simulates the campaigns in Egypt and Libya from December 1940 until January 1943, as well as the peripheral operations on Malta and Cyprus, and in Syria and Lebanon. \nTwo 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps display the battlegrounds from Tripoli to the Levant, along with Cyprus, Crete, Malta, and part of Sicily. Over a dozen types of terrain are charted. More than 400 die cut cardboard counters represent the military units that took part in the campaign.

Perhaps the most dramatic of the many desperate battles fought in front of Moscow, these two battles combined all the elements of the great struggle. The Germans have an excellent fighting machine but are short on fuel and time. They must capture their objectives on a tight schedule or snow and mud will end their offensive. The Soviets are down to the rearward remnants of their once immense armies. If the Soviets can avoid being encircled by the fast moving German forces, high quality reinforcements from the Far East may finally allow them to stop the German advance.\n\nHistorically, the Soviets stood fast at Mozhaysk, fighting heavily even on the old Napoleonic battlefield of Borodino. Like Napoleon, the Germans eventually took the field, but at great cost in time and manpower. Near Mtsensk Guderian&rsquo;s Panzer spearhead advancing north from Orel was ambushed by the Soviets thereby disrupting the German timetable. This gave the Soviet 6th Guards Rifle Division time to dig-in on the heights above Mtsensk thereby barring the way to Tula and Moscow.\n Roads to Moscow uses the same mechanics found in the acclaimed Roads to Leningrad: Battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russa, 1941 game, featuring a chit draw for activation of formations. Both players quickly learn how to use their motorized units effectively for overruns, combined arms, and movement of reserves. The game includes special rules for Soviet rocket artillery, NKVD, and self-propelled gun units, and fuel supply shortages, and much more, all without overwhelming play of the game.\n\nGame Scale:\nTurn: 12 hours\nHex: 1.4km (Mozhaysk ), 1.2km (Mtsensk)\nUnit: Company to Battalion for most combat units, with Brigade &amp; Division HQs\n\nCOMPONENTS\n    Three counter sheets (528 5/8&quot; counters)\n    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; Mapsheet (front &amp; back printed)\n    4 Player Aid set-up cards\n    1 Charts &amp; Tables card\n    Rule book\n    Play book\n    1 ten-sided die\n\nDESIGNER: Vance von Borries\nDEVELOPER: Mark Guttag\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

Will you take on challenges or hire help, develop your town or command its heroes? Your strategies, risks, and fortune can transform your village into a thriving city or forgotten ruins.\n\nOverview:\nVillagers and Villains is a card game with over 100 unique cards. The game is played over several rounds. Each round has 6 distinct Phases. During each Phase, all players (Mayors) have a chance to take specific actions. The Mayor who builds the most successful village wins.\n\nGame play: \nVillagers and Villains is a building game. In the 1st phase players recruit cards from a common pool neutral to all players. 4 classes of cards could appear in the pool: Challenges, citizens, buildings, and heroes. Each card has different game play applications and different effects on end scoring. In the 2nd phase each player has a chance to defend their town from challenges. In the 3rd phase challenges loot towns left unprotected. The 4th phase is when each town earns money. In the 5th phase money can be spent to expand a town by hiring heroes and citizens or creating buildings. The final phase resets the board for a new round of phases. The starting player changes and rounds continue until a town reaches a fixed size. At that time the game is scored.\n\nGoal:\nIn the end each town is scored based on a variety of facets and features. Players have to assess which facet will score the most points as the game is played--and circumstances dictate.\n\nFeatures: \nThe game ships with a basic and advanced version for experienced and novice gamers and special 2-player game rules. In the advanced game players gain access to the king's favor, special card powers, and pairing options for final scoring. In addition, the home site offers a variety of rules variations for added game play.

The only condition on these actions is that, at the conclusion of the turn no two stones of the same color can be diagonally adjacent unless they are orthogonally connected by a common like-colored stone.\n\nForced Passing: In the very unlikely event that a player will not have a legal move on his turn, he must pass his turn. passing is otherwise strictly prohibited.\n\npie rule: The pie rule has questionable efficacy in classic Slither, as any stone can be translated to the middle of the board without even a loss of tempo. This rule states that\n\nNo draws are possible in Slither.\n\nAdvanced Slither: Seasoned Slither players may want to upgrade to Advanced Slither, which is a variant from late 2018 which aims to resolve issues generated by the perhaps excessive mobility of stones, chiefly making the pie rule less superfluous. The only additional rule in advanced Slither is that a stone may only move if its part of a contiguous orthogonal group consisting of stones of both colors. In addition to making pie more effective and foiling opening templates, this rule makes the game both more static, and therefore strategic and more tactically rich. speaking as its designer, I would have released this version of Slither if I had discovered its relative merits in 2010, despite how this may have effected Slither's reputation.", "['Card Game', 'Fantasy', 'Humor', 'Party Game'] ['Closed Drafting', 'Hand Management', 'Memory', 'Set Collection', 'Take That'] Host the perfect party by drafting mismatched guests and crazy party themes.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Deduction'] ['Hexagon Grid', 'Square Grid'] Black Box+ is a deluxe expanded edition of Black Box that includes the original square grid game as well as a challenging new hexagonal version.

The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.\n\nIn Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.\n\nThe Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.\n\nPlayers have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.\n\nDesigned by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics.

New Zealand and Australia were the first to issue the challenge, but soon after Scotland, South Africa, and the United States joined in. Then Spain, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and even Brazil intervened. England proudly refused to be forced into this dispute and proposed a worldwide racing championship be held in the Suffolk countryside in order to establish who were the world's supreme sheep farmers. Thus, the sheep race became an incredible and fascinating reality...\n\nIn The Sheep Race, players must place bets on three races, with six sheep participating in each race. Each sheep starts with a number of &quot;breath&quot; cubes (in three colors) on it, along with numbers for three speeds of movement: trot, walk, and gallop.\n\nOn a player's turn, he rolls the two dice &ndash; one a normal d6 and the other having values 0-0-0-1-2-3 &ndash; then moves the sheep in the appropriate lane, with a 7 or 8 moving the sheep in the outer two lanes and a 9 moving the lazy sheep at the back of the pack. When you move a sheep, you choose one of the three types of movement, advance the sheep the indicated number of spaces, and remove the appropriate breath cubes required &ndash; or you make the sheep rest so that it recovers two blue breath cubes.\n\nIf a sheep hits the &quot;end zone&quot; &ndash; the final five spaces of a lane &ndash; with no cubes on it, then the sheep is exhausted and can't move or rest again. The race ends when three sheep reach the finish line or when all the sheep are exhausted. The first three positions pay off for those who bet on them, even if one or more of those positions contains an exhausted sheep.\n\nPlayers place three bets in the first two races (two secret and one visible) and two bets in the final race (both secret).

As a tactical representation of naval warfare, each of the ships is accurately modeled for offensive capability including gunnery, ramming and spar torpedoes; for defensive capability including damage and five distinct armored or wooden hit locations; and for maneuverability, crew size and draft.\n\nYou command 70 famous ships of the era, including the Union: Onondaga, Tecumseh, Winnebago, Monitor, Osage, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Hartford, Essex, Carondolet, Kearsarge, Ossipee, Queen of the West, Iroquois, Spuyten Duyvil; and the Confederate: Tennessee, Virginia, Atlanta, Palmetto State, Arkansas, Albemarle, Alabama, Florida, General Beauregard, Sumter; and many more.\n\nMany of the 14 scenarios, in this easy-to-learn game, are playable in an hour or less. Included are 13 historical and 1 hypothetical engagements featuring Hampton Roads, Mobile Bay, Trent&rsquo;s Reach, Wassaw Sound, the duel between Alabama and the Kearsarge, and the saga of the Arkansas, which may be played as three individual scenarios or as a linked mini-campaign.\n\nIn addition, forts bristling with guns make their appearance to challenge the will of the ship captains. If that was not enough to heat things up, scenario based optional rules add a few interesting &lsquo;what if&rsquo; situations to expand on play.\n\nIf you are interested in commanding your own fleet, Iron and Oak includes a standalone campaign module where player selected forces fight it out in the many rivers, bays, inlets and costal areas. The campaign game recreates the brown water actions, typical of the period, in a series of randomly generated battles. As play progresses, the players do not know the exact length of the campaign or the specific mix of the battles. Players must not only manage the unfolding battles, but must also strategically allocate resources and repair and refits their ships. The 16 card Navy Yard deck is used to plot a course through and influence the challenges of the campaigns.\n\nTwo or more players battle it out on an 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map that features an area movement grid. This simple approach controls ship movement as well as all combat action. Gone are the long periods of inaction, typical of ACW tactical naval games, as these early steam-era ships struggled to maneuver into battle.\n\nThis innovative game system places the emphasis on quick action and tactical decision making. The 50 Action Cards are used to assist and enhance play, not drive it. Each time you battle it out, whether in a scenario or campaign game, the action unfolds in a very different manner. Do you wish to employ hot shot or incendiary shells? Is now the best time to rapid fire or is it wise to maneuver and ram? Should you allocate part of the crew as a repair party? Is that enemy ship going to maneuver into your torpedo (mine) field? These and many other possibilities exist through the play of the action cards. Or, you may decide to not play any action cards at all and just maneuver and shoot. You control how and when the action will unfold.\n\nAt its core Iron and Oak is a naval simulation. It accurately models the close-range slugging matches typical of the period. You have the opportunity to play out the various battles to their conclusion. Will history repeat itself, or will a new account be written? Will the Monitor&rsquo;s 11&rdquo; Dahlgren smoothbores blast through Virginia&rsquo;s armor plating or will their battle again end in a stalemate? Will the powerful Tennessee win out against Admiral David Farragut&rsquo;s Union fleet or again fall to his superior numbers?

So do you.  Players in the game of Eons take on the roles of universal architects competing to shape the universe on a cosmic scale by gathering elemental building blocks to create stars, planets, and other cosmic phenomenon.  In a strategy game like no other, the architects engage the laws of the cosmos, using stars to forge more complex elements and form other heavenly bodies.\n\nIn EONS, players must spend their own essence to marshal these elements, carefully gauging their resources and the benefits received from their planets and stars, as they guide the formation of their cosmos eon after eon; working to achieve the most victory points through a variety of strategies and hidden agendas to achieve their version of the universe.  Because eventually, the universe will end, and only one player will be victorious...\n\nPlayers build stars using elements commonly found in the universe, Hydrogen, Carbon, Oxygen and Iron.  Once they build stars, the stars perform fusion, and can produce resources for the player to use to build additional stars, planets or other cosmic events.  Each cosmic body the player builds is worth Essence, representing the power and influence the Architect has in the universe, and that Essence can be used to purchase more elements from the elemental stockpile to build more items.  Players can also destroy stars and collect resources from the dead stars, and this is where the game turns to strategy and planning.  Every cosmic body that is destroyed will decrease the entropy countdown, and when it reaches 0, the game is over.\n\nRemaining cosmic bodies that grant victory points are totaled, and the player with the most victory points, wins!  Although the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of the game, you will find that the game is also a resource management game, as if you deny resources that stars need to undergo fusion, they will die and accelerate endgame.

In a battle scenario, two players will command either the Jacobite forces or the units of the Government army. There are 13 battle scenarios in the game. A scenario&rsquo;s battle notes state which player takes the first turn and players will alternate taking turns thereafter until one player reaches the number of Victory Banners indicated in the scenario&rsquo;s victory conditions.\n\nThe Jacobite Rising battlefield game board has a hex grid of 13 hexes wide by 11 hexes deep. The battlefield is divided into three sections by two dotted lines, giving each player a Left Flank Section, a Center Section and a Right Flank Section. Where the dotted line cuts through a hex, the hex is considered to be part of both the flank section and the center section. Terrain Tiles represent a range of terrain features and are placed on the battlefield to recreate the historical scenario setting.\n\nA Command card is played each turn by the active player to order troops on a player&rsquo;s side to move, battle, or do something special. The mix of units both players may have under their commands include; regular infantry, highland infantry, lowland infantry, militia infantry, battle cavalry, light cavalry, trained artillery, light artillery and leaders. Units are represented by a group of 4 blocks in a hex and a single block represents a leader. Units and leaders may only move and battle when given an order. During a turn when units are battling, the battle dice will resolve combat quickly and efficiently and when the last block of an opposition unit or leader block is eliminated, a player will gain one Victory Banner. Again the number of banners needed to win is detailed in a scenario&rsquo;s victory conditions.\n\nIn a Jacobite Rising Tricorne battle, unit morale is one of the main thematic concepts, as it was historically. It is possible that units which have taken few-- or even no-- losses will run off the battefield at the first combat, which will definitely keep players on the edge of their command chairs during an entire battle.\n\nTo further emphasize the differences in battlefield doctrine between the Highland Clans and Government forces, each army has its own unique deck of Combat cards. These cards represent a mix of unit training, abilities, and surprising actions that take place during the course of a battle.\n\nAs with other Commands &amp; Colors games, the scale of the game fluctuates, which allows players to effectively portray some of the larger historical Jacobite Rising battles, like Culloden and Falkirk, as well as smaller size skirmish actions. The 13 battle scenarios in the game present a stylized battlefield map that emphasize the important terrain features and highlights the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Still the tactics of the period, that players will need to execute to gain victory, conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various armies of the day and the battlefield terrain features on which they fought.\n\nHere is the list of 13 battles and smaller skirmish actions included with Jacobite Rising:\n\n\n     Killicrankie - 27 July 1689\n     Dunkeld - 21 August 1689\n     Cromdale - 1 May 1690\n     Alness - 10 July 1715\n     Sheriffmuir - 13 November 1715\n     Glen Shiel - 10 June 1719\n     Prestonpans - September 1745\n     Clifton - 18 December 1745\n     Inverurie - 23 December 1745\n     Falkirk (Stage 1) - 17 January 1746\n     Falkirk (Stage 2) - 17 January 1746\n     Culloden - 16 April 1746\n     Culloden (Flanking Move) - 16 April 1746\n\n\nAgain, owners of Compass Games The American Revolution Commands &amp; Colors: Tricorne will find many familiar game mechanics in this stand-alone game product, but there are also plenty of new and interesting play concepts, which  add historical depth and will provide even the most veteran Commands &amp; Colors players new experiences and challenges as they are introduced into the world of the Highland Clans in the time of the Jacobite Risings.\n\n&mdash;description from the publisher", "['Card Game', 'Humor', 'Negotiation', 'Party Game', 'Pirates'] ['Hand Management', 'Voting'] In the card game Jolly Roger: The Game of Piracy &amp; Mutiny, you're a crew member aboard a pirate ship and have just elected a new captain.

Every turn you get more thirsty and hungry and exhausted. The thirstier and hungrier you are, the more exhausted you become, and that determines how much energy you will have each turn. If the exhaustion hits the bottom, you die. The energy is used to walk, but also to search for food or rest. To regain your strength (reduce your exhaustion) you also have to sleep. One of the biggest risks is encountering a predator since they attack you with two dice and you defend with only one and increase exhaustion equal to the difference. And they can scent you from a mile away...\n\nThe game board is discovered gradually as players progress across it, and there are six turns each day (four day turns, two night turns). Each day has different special rules and each landscape tile has its own challenges. Each landscape tile has 21 hexagonal areas in a big triangle and each area has a terrain type such as mountain, wood, swamp and so on, and the tile may also include a predator lair. Different terrain types have their benefits and challenges. The combination and orientation of different landscape tiles make the way forward uncertain and new every game. To top it off, the players have a limited supply of cards that can be played to help yourself or thwart your opponent in certain situations.\n\nBesides the normal six-tile board, the game can be played in an easy, short version by having only four landscape tiles, or it can be played in a challenging long version by including all eight available landscape tiles.\n\nThe hand-made edition of Wilderness sold out at Spiel 2011.

Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits.\n\nGENERAL INFO: A euro game for 1-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes.\n\nTHEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich!\n\nHOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting.\n\nWINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid.\n\nMECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of Power Dice, these are community dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid.\n\nAfter all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Power Die is rolled. A player starts his/her turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully.\n\nThroughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks.\n\nWhen 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game.\n\nDarkrock Ventures will also include special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant.", "['Exploration', 'Fighting', 'Horror', 'Miniatures', 'Movies \\\\/ TV \\\\/ Radio theme', 'Zombies'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board', 'Roll \\\\/ Spin and Move'] Be the first survivor to reach the helipad and leave or kill 25 zombies to win!", "['Civil War', 'Pike and Shot', 'Political', 'Religious', 'Wargame'] ['Action Points', 'Campaign \\\\/ Battle Card Driven', 'Dice Rolling', 'Events', 'Hand Management', 'Minimap Resolution'] Challenging solo game: can Parliament prevail in the English Civil Wars?", "['Aviation \\\\/ Flight', 'Bluffing', 'Deduction'] ['Simultaneous Action Selection', 'Team-Based Game', 'Voting'] In Mayday!Mayday! all players are flight crewmembers aboard flight LK-886, on which the pilot has suddenly died.

Shop 'til ya Drop . . . \n    Combat mechanics that put a major, detailed emphasis on sieges and ravaging the surrounding areas, but still allow for the predilections of the various armies in field battles (such as the famous Frankish Heavy Cavalry Charge), as well as the abilities of their commanders . . . men like the great initial Crusaders, such as Raymond, Bohemond, Godfrey and Tancred, King Louis VII of France (and his troublesome wife, the famous Eleanor of Aquitaine), Frederick Barbarossa (if he stays away from the pool), the dangerous Nur ad-Din, the magnificent Saladin, and the one Christian the Muslims feared more than anyone, Richard Lionheart.\n    Movement and attrition go hand in hand in this game. Leaders may move as far as they want\n    The game uses three sets of cards (110 cards total). Each of the four Crusader factions -- Northern Franks, Southern Franks, Sicilian Normans, Germans -- and three Muslim factions -- Northern Syrians, Southern Syrians, Mosul Turks -- has three or four Leader cards, which the players secretly &quot;purchase&quot; at the beginning of the Game-Turn to create the Activation Deck that determines which leader goes next. In addition, there are two Event Decks - one for the Crusaders and one for the Muslims -- through which a variety of random events occur, ranging from taking cities via treachery to suffering added attrition through oppressive heat.\n    Normally, each Leader controls armies only from its own faction. However, a simple set of multi-faction rules controls situations in which either side wishes to combine their armies into larger forces, mostly for the sake of sieges against major cities. The Siege of Antioch, which usually happens early in the game, often requires such an army. The multi-faction rules particularly come into their own during multi-player games; here you can expect to see players bickering over who controls the combined forces, an important point considering that whoever is in charge when the city falls gains control over the city. If attacked while combined, the players of a multi-faction force have 30 seconds to decide who's in charge: if they don't, they defend using a mediocre formation.\n\n\nCOUNTERS: 876 full color counters\nMAP: One 22&quot;x34&quot; full-color map\nCARDS: 110 Cards\nOTHER:\n\n     Two six-sided dice\n     First Crusade Rule book\n     Second and Third Crusade Rule book\n     Playbook\n     4 Player Aid cards \n\n\nDESIGNER Richard Berg\nDEVELOPER Neil Randall\nART DIRECTOR Rodger B.

Brettspiel retains the central element of the 6 nimmt! card game: Each player reveals a card from their hand at the same time, then the cards are added to a central display with players possibly being penalized should their card end up in the wrong location.\n\nIn more detail, the game includes tiles numbered 1-100, and each player receives a hand of twelve tiles. Four tiles are revealed at random and placed in the first position of the first four rows on the game board. On a turn, each player chooses a tile, then reveals them all at the same time, with the tiles being added to the game board from lowest number to highest. A tile is placed in a row to the right of a tile with a lower value, with the smallest difference between tiles mattering should multiple options be available. (For example, a 16 would be placed to the right of 14 and not 7 should both of those numbers be present in different rows.) If a tile is lower than all rightmost tiles, then you place it to the right of the tile with the highest value.\n\nIf the tile is placed on a space with a positive or negative bullhead symbol, the player gains or loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their played tile. If the tile fills the final spot in a row, then the player loses points equal to the sum of bullheads on all other cards in this row, then this card is moved down the game board to the first position in the highest empty row.\n\nOnce everyone has played all of their tiles &mdash; or in a two- or three-player game, refilled their hand, then played through a second set of twelve tiles &mdash; the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.\n\nIf you like, you can play 6 nimmt! Brettspiel with &quot;good luck cards&quot;. Whenever you score negative points, you draw such a card from the deck. These cards either convert a non-final row space on the game board to +5 points (instead of whatever it was) or convert a final row space to a bonus that might end up netting you points instead of losing them.\n\nOn the back of the 6 nimmt! Brettspiel game board is a second board to be used with the &quot;professional version&quot; of the game. In addition to the &plusmn;bullhead spaces, this board has spaces that force you to draw a new tile, claim all the tiles in a row (instead of scoring negative points), or draw an action card. These action cards let you play anywhere, swap your played tile for another from your hand, skip to the front line, and more. This version can be played with or without the &quot;good luck cards&quot;.

Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to try and break the other sides lines. Additional rules are included for amphibious invasions. Several scenarios cover every major point of the war. The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Western Europe and Italy printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is one section of the complete EuroFront series that covers the entire European conflict of WWII.\n\nThis title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.\n\nRe-implemented as:\n\n    WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 ??Second Edition\n\n\nExpanded by:\n\n    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Civilization'] ['Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Mancala', 'Set Collection'] A mancala-building game set in an astonishing afrofuturistic universe.", "['Book', 'Napoleonic', 'Wargame'] ['Action \\\\/ Event', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Fight for and against Napoleon's army in the Iberian Peninsula.", "['Abstract Strategy'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Simultaneous Action Selection'] United we stand and divided we are pizza toppings.", "['Fantasy', 'Territory Building'] ['Action Queue', 'Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Cube Tower', 'Multiple Maps'] Each game is another episode in the eternal cycle of war between Light and Dark.", "['City Building', 'Territory Building'] ['Connections', 'Events', 'Pattern Building', 'Set Collection', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Plan and build a sprawling MICRO metropolis!", "['Card Game', 'Dice', 'Fantasy'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] Play as Noa and destroy the Goomz and protect Eden!", "['Bluffing', 'Deduction', 'Spies \\\\/ Secret Agents', 'Trains'] ['Semi-Cooperative Game', 'Traitor Game', 'Voting'] Hidden traitor game with social deduction... on rails!", "['Card Game', 'Fighting', 'Nautical', 'Pirates'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Modular Board'] Corsairs is essentially a card game where players attempt to assemble the correct combination of provisions in order to be able to board galleys, whilst possessing a strong enough crew in order to board the ship and fend off their opponents potential counterattacks. The game comes with 30 galleys tiles in five different colors. Four of these galleys are placed face-up on the table and are ripe for the taking. Each galley indicates the combination of provisions which must be played before a player can attempt to board it. In addition, each galley indicates the victory points it is worth, as well as the 'boarding' strength, which must be met or exceeded for it to fall prey to the pirates.\n\nPlayers are each dealt an initial hand of six cards, most of which depict one of six different types of provisions (water, bread, meat, rum, bananas or beans). In addition, several cards depict corsairs (pirates) with values ranging from 2 - 4.\n\nOn their turn, players must play 3 cards. They may play them:\n\na) beside a galley to begin amassing provision cards so as to eventually match the provision requirements indicated on the galley. \nb) to the discard pile, replacing them with cards chosen from rummaging through the discard pile\nc) 'fire a broadside' by playing any card to the discard pile and rolling dice.

It is aimed at those game players who enjoy rules that are very simple and easy to get into. The game is not intended to be a simulation of the era, but immerses the players in the flavor of the period.\n\nGameplay:\nEach player starts with a few regions (one of which is his capital), and a few military units. Players expand their power bases by adding regions to their &quot;sphere of influence&quot;. This may be done either through diplomacy (they join willingly), or military conquest (they join, period).\n\nThere are three major sub-games in Attack!:\n1) Land Combat: A simple system where each unit has certain advantages based on its historical role.\n\n2) Sea Combat: A simple system where each ship type (Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer, and Sub) has certain advantages based on its historical role.\n\n3) Economic: A simple system determines production. The player starts with one card per region owned, and then gets a new one for each new region added. The cards come in four basic flavors (suites): Resources, Factories, Transport Network, and Oil. Each card has a value printed on it that represents the base economic value of that region. If the player is able to create an entire &quot;set&quot; (one of each suite), he doubles the printed value on those cards. There is also a fifth type of card which has a minimum value of &quot;1&quot; that represents a region without any special economic value (just &quot;population&quot;).\n\nThe units include: Infantry, Tank, Artillery, and Air. These are high quality plastic minis, which come in two sizes: regular for only one unit and slightly larger for groups of five.\nThe map shows the world circa 1935 centered around the Atlantic (North and South America, Europe, and Africa).

Aircraft perform the same kind of missions too, but with a much longer range.\n\nThe activation point system creates great uncertainty in the game, so every game plays out differently: players must carefully plan their strategy and constantly make fundamental decisions. It is a game of great tension and depth, where desperate counter-attacks alternate with strategic surprises; the attention of players must always be constant.\n\nOther detailed rules cover: combat, breakthroughs, artillery, reserves, reinforcements, replacements, naval support, supply in mountainous terrain and flat land and, of course, victory conditions.\n\nHOW TO WIN\n\nThe German player has obviously a chance to win the game right away if he manages to repel the US 5th Army in Salerno.\n\nIf the German player does not win, the game goes on, and the Allies must conquer Rome, trying to eliminate the armies of the Axis powers, in order to win. The Axis wins if the Allies do not reach their victory conditions or if, in any moment, the losses for the Allies go over a certain level.

Death does not frighten you near so much as the thought of Farrenroc falling to Darkness.\n\nAnd now, here you stand&mdash;at the gates of the last city, facing the uncertain lands beyond.

Heroes must contend with these threats while also mustering the support of the land to unite against a mutual foe.\n\nDark Frontier combines high adventure with resource management, programmed action selection, and epic conquest to create a unique gaming experience to further enrich the world of Myth.\n\nPlayers take on the role of iconic heroes from the world of Myth, aiding the besieged city of Farrenroc in its never-ending quest to push back the Darkness. Each hero has a small deck of five actions: Travel, Battle, Encounter, Fortify, and Quest. Three of the five are selected and placed in one of three time slots (morning, day, and night). These selections are made for all heroes and the enemy at the same time, then shuffled. Each time phase is played out by drawing and executing the action, be it a hero or an enemy. Oftentimes the timing of these actions is important to accomplish a quest or encounter, or to push back invading forces. Players will need to discuss their planned actions with each other and play them in the appropriate time slots.

Red Typhoon simulates the early 1942 Russian counter-offensive in front of Moscow that almost destroyed Army Group Center. Can you as the Soviet player complete the destruction or can you as the German player survive the Soviet onslaught.\n\nRed Typhoon is a two player game following an IGO-UGO turn sequence with activation points controlling the movement and attack of each of your formations. This means that some units will not move or attack, some will just move or just attack and some will both move and attack. The players choices of how to use his activations is the most important decision in the game. Combat is fairly traditional with the additions that units are retreated by the attacking player and that retreated units are disrupted. Players able to take advantage of these two factors will be successful.\n\nThe game starts with several large Soviet breakthroughs that the German player must skillfully plug and in certain situations counterattack. There are special rules for German panzers, Soviet Airborne and Partisans.\n\nFirst published as Panzer Korps 04: Red Typhoon in Command Magazine (Japan) #85 (Mar-Apr 2009)", "['Collectible Components', 'Dice', 'Fantasy', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures'] ['Dice Rolling'] Like the first edition of the Dungeons and Dragons Miniatures Game, players pit their warbands against each other on a battle map. Warbands consist of models, each with their own respective characteristics and points values.  A typical warband consists of 200 points worth of models, with a maximum model count of 10.\n\nThe mechanics has been revised and streamlined, though the overall structure remains. The game has been updated to correspond with the change from 3rd to 4th Ed. Dungeons and Dragons Roleplaying Game.\n\nThe three sets released for this game were Dungeons of Dread, Against the Giants and Demonweb. Each is a set of 60 figures, with 8 random figures in each pack, Giants included huge figures. A fourth set, Feywild, was announced but not released. The Starter Set released with Dungeons of Dread, contains a rulebook, five fixed models, their stat cards, counters for tracking damage, a twenty-sided die and two double sided battle maps.\n\nNotable changes in the 2nd Edition:\n\n     Alignment has been simplified. The &quot;Chaotic&quot; and &quot;Lawful&quot; tags have been removed. Only models considered to be absolutely &quot;Good&quot; or &quot;Evil&quot; are given an alignment.\n     Warband building is no longer based on alignment, but on &quot;Factions&quot;. Each model belongs to one or more of four factions. Every model in a warband must share at least one faction.\n     Commanders are gone, replaced by champions. Models no longer make morale checks or rout. Models reduced to half damage are &quot;bloodied.&quot; Certain game effects may trigger from this state.\n\n\nWizards of the Coast is revising all the stat cards from 11 sets of the first edition of the game to make them compatable with the new version of the game. These stats will be available online in PDFs.\n\nWizards of the Coast will continue to release miniatures for use with the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying game.

It is the first in the series to cover the Infantry Regiment Grossdeutschland in World War II.\n\nThe German breakthrough at Sedan opened the way for Guderian&rsquo;s dash to the English Channel. What is not commonly known is that this advance proceeded at a pace which the German General Staff thought to be too aggressive, if not rash. It is not an understatement to say that had the French significantly threatened the Sedan bridgehead, the 1940 campaign could have developed quite differently. The French lost their best opportunity to do just that at the village of Stonne. In GD&rsquo;40, players have the chance to change history. A successful French player may cause OKW to put the brakes on Guderian&rsquo;s advance, which could give the French army time to react to the surprise German blow at Sedan. Failure will allow history to take its course&mdash;one of the most decisive victories of modern time. GD&rsquo;40 is the first in a series of TCS games which will portray the Grossdeutschland throughout the war&mdash;from an infantry regiment in 1940 to a Panzer Corps in 1945.

The game has been designed to ensure that, just as in reality, the commanders (you) are fully occupied with decision making from the outset. Your key objective is to outmanoeuvre the enemy army and concentrate your forces at critical points in the battle. This will then destroy the enemy's will to fight, deal a devastating blow to the morale of their commanders (your opponent) and allow you to win.\n\nOur companion army list books will contain historical overviews and the organisation of hundreds of accurately researched armies, ensuring that your battles will be able to have a realistic and historical feel.\n\nAlso, in reality, some armies would be relatively small, consisting of as few as 5,000 men, whilst others would be enormous. Field of Glory will allow you to see what might have been had these forces been equally matched, using a points system, as each army can then be scaled up or down whilst retaining an individual mix and balance of troops to create &ldquo;what if&rdquo; encounters.\n\nWe started with a blank sheet of paper and looked at a wide range of possible mechanisms. Some concepts are entirely new. Others may look familiar at first glance, but interact with the rest of the rules in a completely new way, giving Field of Glory a style all its own.\n\nIn Field of Glory our most important objective is to make the game fun to play whilst retaining a strong historical feel.

The cards not only represent the Powers, various capabilities, and events that the players use to gain victory, but they also provide the playing board, a map that is divided into 19 Cards, only 8 of which start the game in play. The rest of the Map Cards - and the map - come into play randomly, but at the players' pace.\n\nThe remaining cards are for the 27 Powers - countries from the strong but troubled Holy Roman Empire, England and France, through the various Islamic powers, down to such minor, but important, countries such as The Kingdom of Jerusalem, Livonia and Trebizond. Even such mysterious and far away areas as Polovtsy and The Cumans come into play. - and the various &quot;events&quot; the players use to forward their schemes.\n\nEach Player represents an ever-changing conglomerate of these Powers, using his wiles, and the cards, to further his control over areas of Europe to win the game. There are Spies, Assassins, accusations of Heresy, Jihads, even the use of the various Knights of Christ.\n\nAnd then there are the Popes. Each player, randomly, can become Pope (they're named and historical). As Pope he can arrange alliances, excommunicate players, and call for Crusades (a great way to make money).\n\nBut hovering like a very, very black cloud over all of this are The Mongols. No player knows exactly when they start to arrive, although the card play does give them hints &hellip; and some time to prepare, if they choose to heed the warnings. But when they do arrive, all Tartar Hell breaks loose, as The Mongols, also represented by cards, literally eat the map, east to west, conquering Powers, chewing them up and making them disappear from European view.\n\nThe winner is the player who survives the onslaughts of religion and the Mongols to control the largest part of 13th century Europe.\n\nMedieval is for 3 to 5 players and takes around 2 hours to play, once you've learned the system.

To become bigger, fish must eat plankton. When you move to a space where there is a fish of the same size or smaller than you, you capture it. Small fish are fast but vulnerable; they can capture small fish but can be captured by any fish, and they are the only ones that can go through shipwrecks.

The result is a more intense and nerve-wracking game that takes place over eight turns (from the end of March to mid-April), at least half of which are composed of three operational phases. Both players will face difficult challenges. The German player needs to re-create the historic breakthrough and has to put in every effort to reach Amiens. The Allied player has to resist succumbing to panic in the first turns in order to organize an effective defense, and then a counter-attack near the end of the game.\n\nWhile the basic rules in Somme 18 are identical to those in Marne 1918 (with the exception of the air rules, which have been completely revised), the advanced rules will be very different. The principal reason is the length of Operation Michael, about fifteen days, which does not give an opportunity for the campaign management rules of Marne 1918 to be used.\n\nSo, all of the unit management tracks have disappeared and have been replaced by one table that manages the replacement and re-construction of units. Strategic movement has also been greatly simplified and adapted to the tempo of the game.\n\nSomme 1918 will of course be enriched by numerous specific rules, simulating the particularities of this battle.\n\n\n     Petain&rsquo;s Reticence: Simulates the French command&rsquo;s lack of urgency in supporting their British allies.\n     The arrival of French reinforcements without their artillery support, allowing a quicker deployment of troops coupled with a reduction in their value.\n     Inter-Allied Cooperation: This will be extremely reduced at the beginning of the campaign.\n     Evolution of the use of Stoss: The doctrine of using assault troops had been principally introduced by General von Hutier, in Russia and Italy. At the beginning of Operation Michael, the generals commanding the Second and Seventeenth armies used their Stosstruppen in frontal assaults, wasting these elite forces and provoking fury from Ludendorff. A rule thus simulates the evolution of this doctrine.\n     The Doullens Conference: At the height of the German offensive, while the French Army under Petain prepared to cut its ties with the British, Haig accepted that he be placed under the command of Foch, finally creating an inter-Allied command. This rule simulates this conference, tied to German conquests. It also plays a part in obtaining victory points.

To catch a pigeon, you must place a tile so that it covers the square or squares with the pigeon(s) you need. You may capture pigeons only if you need them; you cannot catch pigeons which belong to a flock already claimed by an opponent, but you can (re)catch pigeons from your or your team's flocks. You receive a tile for each pigeon captured and place those tiles on your goal card.\n\nWhen you fill a goal tile, you place the tiles on it on your mat, optionally take a new goal card, play the now-freed goal card, then place the tiles on your mat wherever you wish to make one of your (or your partner's) flocks bigger, provided either of you have already built a dovecote to claim a particular flock as your own.\n\nYou can also use the tiles to breed falcons. You need to discard two of them to get a baby falcon and two more on a subsequent turn to have it grow into an adult falcon that you can then send to prey on your opponents' flock and make it smaller.\n\nThe game ends when no more goal cards can be drawn; any player with an unfulfilled goal card loses four points. Each player counts the tiles or squares forming the flocks claimed by their dovecotes, and the player or team with the highest score wins.", "['Card Game', 'Humor', 'Party Game'] ['Acting', 'Cooperative Game', 'Team-Based Game'] Create a new language each time you play.", "[] ['Dice Rolling', 'Track Movement'] Use dice to move rockets through space, ideally finding more rockets on the way.", "['Abstract Strategy', 'Mythology'] ['Slide \\\\/ Push', 'Square Grid'] From the publisher's website:\n\nOshi, which means &ldquo;Push,&rdquo; is inspired by a Japanese legend in which the Goddess Amaterasu gifted the first Japanese emperor with her ancient wisdom, in the form of a game.

Like its predecessor, Fatal Alliances is all encompassing and represents every theater and aspect of the First World War. Fatal Alliances expands upon the military system of World in Flames to highlight the diplomatic and civilian fronts.\n\nWhen we think of the First World War, we often think of miles of static trenches stretching along the Western Front. Indeed trench warfare was a huge component of the war, but many theaters in the Middle East, Russia, the Balkans, and even Africa were very dynamic &ndash; as even the Western Front was at times. Moreover, Fatal Alliances focuses on the major technological changes the war brought on, on land, at sea, and in the air. In order to prevail on the battlefield, you must coordinate artillery, elite ace-led air forces, gas units, shock troops, engineering units, infantry, cavalry, and early tanks.\n\nThe First World War was truly global, and in Fatal Alliances, the Eastern Front, the Middle East, the Caucasus, Africa, and even Asia and the Americas play a major role. German forces are loose in Africa, and South Africa's loyalty is uncertain. Italy will go to the highest bidder. The Ottomans face Russians in the Caucasus and British Forces along the Suez Canal. China is in turmoil, and could potentially join either side. Japan is nominally an Ally, but Japanese expansionism is already at odds with the interests of other Allied powers. Russia is primed for revolution, with Bolsheviks facing Tsarist forces in a battle for control of the largest swath of land in Eurasia.\n\nTo guide your nation to victory, you must navigate the world of international politics, swaying both minor and major powers to your side. Can you survive civil unrest or military revolution at home, while instigating it abroad? Can you prevent your troops from refusing to fight, and maintain control of your far-flung colonies? Strategic warfare on the seas and in the air must form a vital part of your strategy, preserving your nation&rsquo;s own will to fight while degrading the enemy&rsquo;s. Whatever your strategy, Fatal Alliances: The Great War is a truly dynamic and all-encompassing simulation of every theater of the First World War.\n\n1680 counters represent the armies, navies, and air forces, which fought in the Great War.

It is played on a 10x10-square checker board with 20 pieces per player. This game is popular in European countries like France, The Netherlands, Russia, Poland and Belgium and in African nations like Congo, Senegal and Ivory Coast. However, there are countries outside these two continents that boast of good players like in the United States, Italy, Israel and Brazil.\n\nRules of the Game: This game is played on a 10x10, or 100 squares checker board where the double corner is on the right of each player.\n\nThe Moves of the Men: Checkers pieces (the Men) can move forward on each empty square to the left or to the right. When these pieces reach the last line on the opponent's side they become Kings.\n\nThe Moves of the King: Kinged pieces can move across multiple squares on the two diagonals that cross their position for so long as these squares are open, in a rule known as the &quot;Flying Kings&quot;.\n\nCaptures: In International Checkers, maximum captures are obligatory, which means that if a player has more than one path to jump to capture his opponent's pieces, they must take the path that will effect the most captures of their opponent's pieces. If a piece lands on the King row during a jump, it must continue jumping backward for as long as there is a jump opportunity. That particular piece cannot be Kinged unless it finishes the move and stops on King row.\n\nCaptures by the Men: Men can effect a capture by moving forward or backward while jumping over a single piece of the opponent provided that the said piece is adjacent to it and the following square is empty. If the Man can jump again from the arrival square to effect another capture, then it must do so.\n\nCaptures by a King: A Kinged piece can capture an opponent's piece if it is on the same diagonal where it is positioned provided that the squares between them are empty and that the square beyond the piece to be captured is also empty. The King can stop on any square within the same diagonal line and if another capture can be effected from any of these squares, then it must continue to do so.\n\nThe Winning Player: The player who cannot move any of their pieces loses the game.\n\nConditions for a Draw:\n\n     By mutual agreement of the players.\n     Both players have played five moves, after a position arises of one King against two pieces, which includes a King.\n     Both players have played sixteen moves, after a position arises of one King against three pieces, which includes a King.\n     Both players have moved twenty five moves solely with Kings and not a single piece was captured.\n     For the third time the same position arises with the same player at move.\n\n\nInformation from checkershistory.com (now defunct)\n\nOnline Play/Apps links can be found in the Community Wiki at the end of the page.", "['Ancient', 'City Building'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence'] Use your small army wisely, to conquer an empire!", "['Dice'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Re-rolling and Locking', 'Set Collection'] Create dice combinations to fill up the spaces in your bookcase.", "['Napoleonic', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Movement Points'] Four battles in Spain using the Napoleonic 20 system.", "['Animals', 'Environmental', 'Puzzle'] ['End Game Bonuses', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Hidden Victory Points', 'Pattern Building', 'Tile Placement'] Grow the forest to host its autumn flora, fauna and funga.", "['Aviation \\\\/ Flight', 'Wargame', 'World War I'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Simulation', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] You?re in command of an Imperial German Navy airship during WW1.", "['Ancient', 'Bluffing', 'Card Game', 'Political'] ['Variable Player Powers'] Exchange gifts at a banquet honoring Caligula, full of extravagance and intrigue.", "['Aviation \\\\/ Flight', 'Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation', 'Zone of Control'] Narvik is an Operational level board-wargame of the historical events surrounding the German invasion of Norway in the spring of 1940.\n\nNarvik is actually two games in one.

This is composed of allies, equipment, fetishes, events, victims, gifts, quests, and several other card types depending on which expansions you are using.  The other deck is a combat deck showing special maneuvers which are used when two characters are engaged in combat.\n\nPlay begins with each player laying out his pack (collection of Character cards).  These are all the characters the player will have for that game.  The game ends when one pack achieves the same number of Renown as they had starting Renown.  Typically, players start with a 20 Renown pack (each character has a Renown) and thus the game ends when someone has 20 renown in their victory pile.\n\nPlay is simultaneous, with all players taking actions at the same time - conflicts are generally resolved based on the renown of the character taking an action; well known characters go first.  The game is split into several phases:\nRedraw - draw your Sept hand back to 5 cards\nRegeneration - heal characters that have been hurt\nResource - play most cards like gifts, equipment etc.\nUmbra - play special umbra cards and actions\nMoot - play special cards which may change rules. These must be voted on by all players.\nCombat - resolve any fights.\n\nEach round a player designates one of his characters as Alpha.  The Alpha becomes the primary actor for that round.  During the combat round, Alphas may:\n1) Attack another Alpha\n2) Attack a victim\n3) Attack an enemy\n4) Challenge an ally or a non-Alpha character\n5) Attack a territory\n6) Do nothing.\n\nCombat is resolved using a separate deck which allows special maneuvers.\n\nRenown (victory points) are earned by defeating rival characters and enemies.

In over six decades since the armistice was signed, three generations of the Kim regime resisted Chinese and Soviet influence, endured floods, famine, isolation and economic sanctions while defiantly pursuing nuclear weapons.\n\nOne player will be the DPRK (Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea), seeking a nuclear deterrent to invasion, improving living standards to prevent uprising, and purging elites to prevent a coup.\n\nAnother player will be the West, aiding defectors to obtain intel, stymieing the missile program to secure the region, implementing sanctions to impede the North Korean economy and further isolating the DPRK from the global community to intensify pressure on the regime.\n\n&mdash;description from the designer", "['Card Game', 'Economic'] ['Stock Holding', 'Trick-taking'] Get the best stocks or make your stocks the best.", "['Economic', 'Pirates'] ['Hand Management', 'Variable Phase Order', 'Worker Placement'] &quot;I remember when the Caribbean was a place where any kid could become rich if he did the right thing in the right moment,&quot; said the old man sitting in the rocking chair near the door of a white hovel, paint peeling off its sides. &quot;Oh, yes!

The game consists of five sets of octahedral stiff paper dice, about 2&quot; per edge, with five team members per set.  These dice have full-color comic-book style artwork by Eduardo Muller and game information printed on each face, and each die represents a character. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles easily with just tabs and slots.  Despite being made from &quot;mere paper,&quot; the dice are surprisingly sturdy, and the use of a good quality card stock means they tend to stay in good condition. Unless you accidentally sit on one, of course.\n\nThe basic goal is to be the first person to reach 50 points, which are earned by &quot;killing&quot; your opponent's characters.  Each turn, you may throw a new character into the arena (if you have any available to throw), have one of your characters use his or her action or power, or have one of your characters move.  Movement is done by rotating a die onto a new face on the table.  If you throw a new character into play, he or she may immediately use his or her power on the side that lands face up. Available powers may be an attack or a special action. Some of the special actions allow you to, in turn, use the powers of other teammates, triggering a cascading reaction across the table.\n\nAttacking is simple: Each attack has a power rating.  If it exceeds the block rating of the defending dice, the defending dice is killed, and the attacker scores its points (printed on side one of each die).  If it is equal or less than the defense value, the defending die is merely moved so that a lower value face is face-up, unless it's been &quot;wounded&quot; so many times that it's already on its lowest face, in which case, it dies.\n\nA basic game of Diceland lasts about 20 minutes.\n\nList of Diceland sets and armies", "['Civilization', 'Economic', 'Farming'] ['Area Majority \\\\/ Influence', 'Pick-up and Deliver', 'Point to Point Movement', 'Simultaneous Action Selection'] In the late Middle Ages, the Canary Islands had faded into obscurity from a European point of view.

The situation is grim. The Soviets are well- supported by heavy artillery and the German line has been steadily retreating, leaving Budapest in grave danger.\n\nOn January 1st, the German IV SS and III Panzer Corps launch a surprise attack to rescue the defenders and recapture the city. By January 12th the attack is stalled in the rough terrain to the west of the city. Hitler shifts the focus of the attack from the west to the south-west and continues the attack on January 18th. Although progress is made, Soviet reinforcements pour into the area and the offensive grinds to a halt.\n\nHitler calls off the attack at the end of January, and by February 14th, after seven weeks of grueling combat, Budapest falls.\n\n\nBy January of 1945 Nazi Germany_s military fate was sealed. There was nothing the German forces in Hungary could have achieved that could have substantially delayed or even mitigated this defeat. That did not deter the German attempt to relieve Budapest. Hitler_s goal in ordering the attack toward Budapest was not the rescue of its garrison, but rather the recapture and retention of the city. The garrison was in fact ordered not to break out but instead to hold and await relief. Few commanders on the German side took the idea of the retention of Budapest seriously, however. Had the relieving German forces gotten to within a few miles of the city, a breakout attempt would probably have been made. Bitter End lets the players explore the tantalizing possibilities.

Each player starts with a set of 16 tokens referred to as stones; one light set and one dark set. The board is placed between players so that there are seven rows and eight columns. To start the game, each player takes a set of stones and stacks two stones on each of their eight home cells; their nearest row. The Roman player uses the light set and goes first. The Gaul player uses the dark set. Players alternate turns.\n\nThe basic units of the game are towers and walls. A tower consists of two like-colored stones in a cell. A wall is a single stone in a cell. Only towers move. The main function of walls is to block the opponent's movement and secondarily they act as stepping stones which can be used later on to create new towers. Towers move by sowing as in Mancala with a stacking limit of two and only like-colored stones may be stacked. Each of the destination cells must be empty or contain a friendly wall. Tower stones can be used to remove adjacent opponent walls. This is done by sacrifice! Material remains equal throughout the game but slowly erodes for both players as players defuse threats. A player is stalemated if unable to move/sow or sacrifice at the start of his or her turn. Going flat out (stalemating yourself) in order to stalemate your opponent can be very satisfying.\n\nMurus Gallicus is a game of balance, space and timing. Players must balance defense and offense. By controlling the board's center, a player can gain mobility. Players must wait for the right moment to squeeze through the opponent's defense. The endgame can be very tense thanks to the balance in material.\n\nThere are several useful structures players can employ. The Gallic Wall consisting of orthogonally connected walls (and sometimes towers) requires the opponent to go around the wall or blast his or her way thorough using a sacrificed stone. The Chariot consists of a tower, wall and empty space aligned. By sowing the towers stones in the direction of the wall, the two-celled formation glides forward. The battering ram consists of two towers and an opponent wall aligned. By sacrificing a tower stone, the opponent's wall can be removed. The remaining chariot formation can then move through the breach on the player's next turn. Lastly, a siege tower is a tower sitting within striking distance of the opponent's home row. Such a tower can tie up many of your opponent's pieces.\n\nThe true excitement of the game is in the playing.

Burroughs.", "['Adventure', 'Science Fiction'] ['Action Points', 'Cooperative Game', 'Hand Management', 'Simultaneous Action Selection'] The Daedalus Sentence is a cooperative escape game that challenges players to use limited actions and effective communication in order to flee from their captors and escape a dangerous and ever-changing prison. Use your actions to explore your surroundings, overcome guards, or change the layout of the prison itself - just be careful that the moves you make to save yourself don't doom a teammate!\n\nIn the year 2083, an alien race known as the Loctae descended on planet Earth, killing billions and capturing and containing the few million that remained. The survivors were sent to locations throughout the galaxy, to work as slaves or as subjects for genetic experiments. The most infamous of these locations, known as the Hive, is a Loctae space station orbiting Ganymede. Here, prisoners are harvested for their genetic material, which is used by the Loctae to make genetic hybrids engineered for aptitude in any skill the Loctae require. A few have tried to escape, but none have succeeded. Those who are not lost in the station's labyrinthine halls are recaptured by the station's guards and then moved to the front of the list of those who are to be processed. The failed escapees blabber about the twisted and spliced creatures that roam the corridors of the maze, as if they were in the Labyrinth of King Minos. The remaining survivors now call their plight &quot;The Daedalus Sentence&quot;, a grim tribute to the facility's designer.\n\nAs the months in The Hive wear on, fewer and fewer prisoners remain. Fearing their subjects would run out before their experiments were completed, the Loctae have confined the remaining prisoners in regenerative pods, so that the organs and marrow taken from the prisoners will regenerate with time. Though expensive, this set up was proving successful for the Loctae until a rogue meteor struck the station, damaging the ship's AI and releasing the bonds that kept the prisoners contained. Now the prisoners have a chance, likely the last one they'll ever have, to brave the halls of The Hive and escape to freedom.\n\nThe main feature of the game is its rotating board. The board has four rotating rings, with players starting in the center prison cells and making their way to the outer ring, where they must find the final exit to make their escape. When players start the game, the entire board will be hidden. As they move from the start location, they need to spend actions to flip over tiles in order to discover the layout of each ring. Their main objective is to find the gate to the next ring, but as they explore they will discover tiles both beneficial and perilous. The tiles may allow them to influence the movement of enemies or the maze itself, but they may also spawn additional enemies that will hunt for the players until subdued. If the players can make their way through all four rings, find the final exit, and escape together, they win!\n\nEnemies will spawn throughout the course of the game, both as the result of exploring tiles and from drawn cards. Unlike many card-driven games however, the players have a glimpse into their future by way of the Theseus Device, which holds eight cards that determine how the rings and enemies will move in coming rounds. All eight cards start hidden, but through die rolls (and cards played from the hands of players in case of emergency), players see some of the cards to come. This allows for careful planning, as players try to anticipate how rings will line up in future rounds, as well as making sure they are not caught in the patrol of any passing enemies. When the game starts, only two cards will be activated per round, but as the players breach additional rings, the number of cards that will activate increases. When playing the recommended timed game difficulty enhancer, this leads to a frantic rush as players try to evade enemies and find the exit while planning ahead for the next activation sequence.\n\nThe Daedalus Sentence is designed to be played at a variety of difficulty levels, and players can mix-and-match the optional difficulty enhancers to achieve the perfect intensity level for their group.

Every player is dealt eight cards, so that no cards remain undealt. Then, each player, starting from the dealer's right and proceeding counter-clockwise, bids in an auction to declare how many points they will score. A player may pass, and hence cannot bid again in that game. The bid represents the number of points that player believes he is capable of accumulating. Bidding continues until all but one player have passed in a round. This remaining player has then &quot;won the bid&quot; and therefore gets to declare the Briscola, i.e. the trump suit. The declarer also declares a specific Briscola card (example, the &quot;Ace of Cups&quot; if Cups was the declared Briscola) and the holder of this card is then determined to be the declarer's partner. Logically, the declarer would  declare the highest Briscola card he does not already hold in the hopes of creating the strongest combined hand between him and his partner.\n\nThe remaining three players are partnered with each other, without their knowledge. Each player, other than the declarer's partner, acts independently, until it is clear which players are partners. Infrequently, the declarer may declare a Briscola card he already holds (if he feels he has a very strong hand), in which case the other four players are partenered against him.\n\nBecause of the unique method of declaration and blind partnering in this variation of the game, it is considered to be one of the most entertaining variations of the game.

Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.\n\nIf you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile.  As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.\n\nIf you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must lose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde.  These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you.  If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.\n\nIf a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane.  Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.\n\nIt isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when.  Be the last player standing and win.  If at any time the entire zombie deck is depleted (because the players have killed all of them rather than using flee), all remaining players alive win together.\n\nThis is a unique cooperative/competitive game where you really feel the tension and inevitability of doom.

Players must guide their nation to victory by capturing key objectives while making sure no one else &mdash; in particular their allies &mdash; gets there first.\n\nPlayers take on the leadership of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, the United States or the Soviet Union. Each of these major powers, in turn, can influence smaller countires like Turkey, Greece or Romania to join the war on their side. They can offer bribes or territory, and sometimes it&rsquo;s more important to decrease someone else&rsquo;s influence than to build up your own.\n\nThe currency of the game is the Basic Resource Point, or BRP. This represents the financial, industrial and agricultural production needed to wage war. BRP&rsquo;s are used to build new units, to pay for offensives, to replace losses suffered in battle, to bribe minor countries, and for a host of other purposes. Each country&rsquo;s production can be affected by conquering or losing territory, or through strategic warfare (chiefly, attacks by submarines and bombers).\n\nOnce activated (usually at a cost in BRP&rsquo;s), land, naval and air units can move and attack enemy units. Combat is resolved by rolling dice, with a result of 6 usually equalling a hit. There are no Combat Results Tables; every factor counts and there are no &ldquo;perfect numbers&rdquo; of units to commit to battle as in some wargames. When a land unit is hit, BRP&rsquo;s can be used to absorb some of the damage, but too many hits and it is reduced in strength or destroyed.

In 1542 Pierfrancesco II Orsini, called Vicino, inherited the fief of Bomarzo, which elected to his residence, along with the fiefs of Collepiccolo, Castelvecchio, Montenero and Mompeo. In 1547 Vicino Orsini wanted to celebrate the grandeur of his family, by commissioning one of the greatest architectural wonders of Italy. Within a natural amphitheater were masterfully carved huge mythological figures, whose sublime beauty enchants and terrifies those who are in their presence. Even today the park is shrouded in mystery: is it a Sacred Grove in which to bring votive offerings to the gods or a Park of Monsters made to scare poor people? It's rumored that Vicino Orsini owed his own fortune to the devotion shown to the gods and to the offers that he brought to them.\n\nIn Bomarzo, you will have to delve into the mystery of the park, to propitiate the gods and obtain their favor.

To set up, divide the cards into two decks &mdash; citizens cards and afterlife cards &mdash; shuffling each and placing them face down as draw decks. One player, selected to be the starting player, takes the starting player card with the (1) icon oriented up, rolls the three four-sided dice, and sets them in front of all the players along with the Bread and Deben counters. The starting player then deals an initial hand of cards &mdash; 2 players: 6 cards, 3 or 4 players: 5 cards &mdash; to each player, as well as 9 Debens worth of tokens.\n\nEach round of game play has two phases:\n\n&bull; Dynasty Phase: In turn, beginning with the starting player, each player plays one, or a set of, citizen cards of the same type in front of them to their &quot;Dynasty&quot;. For each additional card played beyond the first, the player must pay 1 Deben per card [Exception: The Scribe]. The player may then use the special ability of that card type as applicable. Note: You only use the Special Ability once when laying down sets of cards within a turn, i.e., even if you play a set of three Priest cards together in one turn, you only look at the afterlife deck once. Citizen cards have three numbered icons on their lefthand side:\n\n1. Victory points (VP) that this card will score at the end of the game.\n\n2. If a player has a clear majority of a type of citizen card (ties do not count) at game end, they gain this additional number of VP. This number may be further multiplied by an afterlife card. This number is also the total number of cards of that type in the deck.\n    \n3. Bread: A player gains additional VP if the Baker feeds that citizen with bread (see: The Baker).\n\n&bull; Discard Phase: After each player has played one or a set of cards, all players must discard down to one card in their hand. The citizen discard and draw decks are then shuffled together and players draw back to their initial hand size. The starting player passes the starting player card to the next player to the left and it is rotated clockwise to the next round number. Lastly, the new starting player again rolls the three four-sided dice and the next round begins.\n\nAfter the required number of rounds &mdash; or if a player cannot draw the required number of cards back from the draw deck at the end of any round &mdash; the game ends.

It depicts a hypothetical corps-level invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Columbia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.\n\nThe game is played on a 35 inch by 42 inch map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately 130 kilometers (81 mi) from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain.\n\nThere are 400 (7 are blank) 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's &quot;untried&quot; status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed.\n\nOn each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both.\n\nInvasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points.\n\nInvasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, in which it was the Soviet Union that was being invaded.", "['American West'] ['Betting and Bluffing', 'Dice Rolling', 'Open Drafting', 'Push Your Luck'] Seven splendid towns &ldquo;wait&rdquo; to be looted by you.

By the next day, a beautiful Pentecost Sunday, the French were on the left bank with 30,000 men, including 6,000 cavalry, and were ready for battle. Grounded on the villages of Aspern and Essling and covered on the wings by the river, their base was solid. For his part, the Archduke Charles decided to go over to the attack quickly so as to destroy the troops who had just crossed the Danube. He had over 60,000 men available, organized into five columns, and before long the Austrians would have 90,000. After the battle had begun, several of the bridges over the Danube were temporarily broken, preventing the French from receiving the reinforcements necessary for victory.

The game is played in turns during which a player rolls his Activation Dice, allowing him to &quot;activate&quot; certain units and move them. These mechanical units &ndash; Links &ndash; are powered by Feronium power crystals, and as they take damage these crystals are depleted. A unit that runs out of crystals is unable to continue functioning and is considered destroyed.\n\nCombat is card- and dice-based. The attacker lays out his Weapon System cards, targeting defending enemy units. Once the attacker has laid out all of his planned attacks, the defender may defend with his own Weapon System cards. These cards can modify the dice rolls that are used to determine the results of the combat. Additionally, due to the experimental nature of the Links and the mysterious happenings in the Abaddon region, things can, and often will, go wrong. These malfunctions and odd happenings are represented by Wild Fire cards, the drawing of which can result in anything from possible shutdowns to anti-gravity surges.\n\nVictory is determined based on stipulations presented by the chosen mission scenarios.

Your goal in NER is to have more assets than other players at game end, as determined by cash in hand, cost of businesses owned, special routes completed and state subsidies acquired.\n\nThe game lasts at most 16 rounds. Each round players forecast the upcoming economic condition &ndash; depression, normal or prosperity &ndash; for a future turn, then take care of any events that occur, such as &quot;Improved Bridge Building Techniques&quot; that allow players to build across estuaries or &quot;Sheep Boom Goes Bust&quot; which represents the decreased demand for wool from New England farmers as the century progressed. Four of the first five events are fixed and represent historical activities, while the other events &ndash; including devastating floods, snow, and an improved business climate &ndash; are randomized into a face-down deck. Players then each draft a business or action card, with the option to play it immediately (thereby gaining a free action) if they choose to pay the cost.\n\nDuring the subsequent development phase, players take two actions in turn order, either building twice, playing cards twice, or doing each action once. Players want to build depots that connect their businesses to one of the major markets in the area: New York, Boston or Montreal; to do so, they need to pay the track costs as well as the cost of the depots themselves. Players can build multiple depots in the same action, but the cost is higher since they're doing more work in the same amount of time. Once a business is connected, it earns the owner more income each turn since it's now supplying a larger, richer market. The cards allow players to start new businesses, play special actions, claim a special route (which generates income), claim one of the six state mail contracts, or collect a state subsidy, which provides special benefits like a free depot.\n\nAs the game progresses, the players pass through time time periods, with different businesses being available in each. The first period focuses on crafts and farms, for example, while the second introduces more industrial businesses such as shoe and textile production. When passing from one period to another, players must choose to make some of their existing businesses obsolete. Since a player can manage only eight businesses, however, you'll likely want to make room for more profitable ventures anyway.\n\nIf all mail routes, state subsidies and special routes are claimed by the end of any round, the game ends at that point; otherwise the game ends after round 16, with the richest player winning New England Rails.", "['Fantasy'] ['Cooperative Game', 'Dice Rolling', 'Role Playing', 'Variable Player Powers'] Testament is a cooperative monster battle card game from Manifest Destiny and LionWing Publishing modeled after the typical &quot;MMORPG trinity&quot; of tank, healer, and damage dealer.\n\nThe players control four characters and choose which skills each character should have.

In most worker placement games like Agricola, Stone Age that seems to be the case.\n\nThis game plays like a typical worker placement game. At the first round each player has 2 workers and they take turn placing their workers one by one onto the basic tiles. The basic tiles consisted of quarry(get a card and take first player),mining(get a card), construction(build a building), Education(increase a worker). At the end of each round you'd have to pay your worker salaries. If you don't have enough money to pay for the workers this round, you'd have to sell some of your private properties and it'd become public to cover the cost.\n\nHere is the most interesting aspect about this game, unlike most other worker placement games, as long as you place workers in the farming/gathering tile the resource for feeding your people is unlimited, they can create enough food for themselves. In this game, the cash flow is limited even if you place the worker in the market tile you can only receive money up to the amount that is available in the pool. The only way to increase the money in the pool is when players cannot pay for their worker and sell their property to bring cash flow into the game, otherwise, there is no way to add more money. At the end of the game, the sum total of the selling prices of all the assets is the victory point.\n\nin this game, If you want to increase population, you can increase it as you like, but unlike other games, population will not score at all except for the effects of some buildings. On the contrary, if the workers cannot produce they will become a huge burden and consume the economy, making accumulation of wealth absolutely impossible.\n\nEssentially, this players have to learn to balance between development of population and the economy. Too few people can not maximize profits. However, if there are too many people they will eat up the profit. Initially, increased workers to increase productivity seems to be very attractive, but when the workers begin to be a burden in the latter half of the game. there is no way to reduce the workers. There is no family planning nor natural disasters, major famine, massacre and cultural revolution in this game.

Soult's Army of the Pyrenees, outnumbered and outclassed by Wellington's veteran forces, fell back towards the east, defending a series of river lines. Wellington's troops, showing excellent coordination between their maneuvering wings, were able to turn Soult out of these strong defensive positions one by one, all the while driving toward the inland city of Toulouse.\n\nOn February 26, Wellington's lead elements were able to exploit a gap in the French cavalry screen and began crossing the Gave de Pau River unopposed, moving in the direction of Orthez. Soult chose not to fall back, and arrayed his six divisions in excellent defensive positions on the high ground north and west of the town. On February 27, he would be attacked by Wellington's eight divisions.\n\nOrthez focuses on the infantry game, and as such serves as an excellent introduction to the system. Artillery plays a supporting role, and there are only a half dozen or so cavalry regiments per side. For the first time we see Wellington and the British on the attack. Command control plays a critical role, and highlights the differences between Wellington's veteran and well-established command hierarchy and Soult's more makeshift organization. British advantages include numerical superiority, command flexibility and their excellent infantry. The main French advantage is the terrific defensive terrain and the defense of interior lines. Make no mistake though, this is a very tough battle for the French.\n\nIn addition to the main battle scenario, there are several smaller scenarios that can be played to conclusion in a long evening.

The game covers the Nanboku-cho period of Japanese history and simulates one of the most dynamic and important periods in Japanese history.\n\nFrom 1336-1392, all of Japan was aflame with war. After the fall of a corrupt and ineffective emperor, the two great courts of Japan dueled to determine the future ruler of the country. Warriors of Japan covers the vital period following the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate and the fight to find a successor.\n\nPlayers of Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453 will find much familiar here, however, unlike the enormous time period covered in Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453, Warriors of Japan covers only 4 years. Subtle changes in the system to cover this unique period have been exchanged in Warriors of Japan. For example, Leaders no longer die from old age but rather can switch sides unexpectedly during a combat. Subtle changes in the movement and combat rules will add to the strategy to a greater extent than in Warriors of God: The Wars of England & France, 1135-1453. A random game start generator will keep each game fresh and interesting. Warriors of Japan also brings us home to our wargaming roots.

The time frame is the not-too-distant future, roughly between now and the end of 2014. On the Chinese side, the viewpoint of the player is that of Peking's top-rung national leadership. On the US side, the opposing player represents the top-rung military commander in the Western Pacific theater. The game is easily adaptable for solitaire play.\n\nThe system &ndash; given we're dealing with events that haven't happened and therefore can't be studied in detail after the fact &ndash; has been crafted to present the war as a unitary vision rather than a strictly sequenced process. The action can alternately telescope or expand, sometimes moving ahead in whip snake lunges, at other times decelerating to dream-like slow motion. The system is more quantum mechanics than Newtonian, more Escher than Rockwell. Its presents a time-space inter-flow that can only be grasped in totality by the human mind once play is over and the entire war can be looked back on and chronicled in a reconstructed linear fashion (much like day-to-day reality).\n\nThree initial assumptions are as follows. First, the Chinese are cast &ndash; not unreasonably, we think &ndash; as the aggressors. Put in terms as politically correct as possible: they're the &quot;revisionist power&quot; here, the nation wanting to overturn the present-day status quo in the Western Pacific: they're conducting a strategic  offensive. Second, the war inevitably starts over Taiwan, as that island is the unavoidably the first strategic block Peking must neutralize on the way to becoming East Asia's hegemon. Third, the war will not begin with a nuclear attack; though the danger of that kind of escalation may not be far off.\n\nMost ground units in the game represent brigades (&quot;brigade combat teams&quot; or &quot;BCT&quot; for the US). The exceptions are: 1) the Singaporean army is entirely represented by just one unit-counter; and 2) the Taiwanese and Philippine armies are represented by their corps components.\n\nAircraft units are mostly represented by mixed-type combat wing formations, though only one aircraft type &ndash; the predominant one for each such wing &ndash; is shown on each counter. Long range bombers have their own mono-type units that can't combine operations with the other tactical air wings in the game.\n\nShip units mostly represent mission-oriented groupings of vessels (Surface Action Groups). Aircraft carriers and cruise missile attack submarines each represent just one such vessel of those types. Other submarines are represented in groups called &quot;Subrons.&quot; On the area map, each inch equals approximately 100 miles.", "['Animals', 'Card Game', 'Dice'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hand Management', 'Push Your Luck', 'Set Collection'] Explore habitats, photograph animals and fulfill your secret assignments..", "['American West', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Post-Napoleonic', 'Wargame'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Simulation', 'Variable Player Powers'] LEGENDS OF THE OLD WEST is a tabletop miniatures game which allows you to bring to life the deeds of the brave lawmen and gunfighters of the most famous period in America's history.

Special tokens are placed out as well: two loot tokens next to the bank, one lock on the museum, and one tunnel next to the manor; six additional loot tokens, along with a car token and the second tunnel, are placed to the side. Three randomly drawn equipment tokens are placed face up.\n\nAt the start of each round, the matchmaker determines the alliances for that round, placing two alliance markers &ndash; each showing a burglar in the appropriate color &ndash; in one area and the other three in the other area.

Who steals the goods? The alliance that has the larger presence there based on the colors of tokens. These tokens are then flipped face down (becoming loot), added to any loot tokens present there, then split among the burglars in the alliance and placed on the scoreboard. The matchmaker token passes to a new player, who must move at least two alliance tokens, then a new round begins.\n\nThe special tokens naturally change the rules: The location with the lock cannot be robbed, although someone can choose to move the lock so that a burglary does take place. The car allows someone to move an equipment token to a new location.

As the Spanish player you will need to determine where you will build your siege gun redoubts and will then have to protect your soldiers from raiding British units to finish the works in time to mount an effective bombardment. As the British player, you have far fewer forces, but armed with special raiding rules, your Regulars, Tories and Indian allies must harass and erode Spanish morale, while delaying the construction of Spanish siege works for as long as possible in the hope of keeping your three forts intact to face the coming coup de main.\n\nThe game begins with Don Bernardo de Galvez&rsquo;s army of 5,000 having just landed on the mainland. How many forces actually are present is decided in a special phase during the initial set-up wherein that portion of the Spanish army that sailed from Havana must run the gauntlet of the Red Cliffs Fort guns.

Once these forces are ashore, the Spanish player faces some hard choices.

Getting a small force into one of two Spanish stockades can be devastating for the Spanish. Thus, though numerically superior, the Spanish player has much to do and protect, and will often be spread thin by a well-conceived series of raids.

For example, a 4 Zombie can be used to claim a &quot;4&quot; contact in the Lava Lounge. Card values can be added and subtracted from each other, allowing players to pinpoint just the right contacts to advance their plans.\n\nHowever, the player could use the card for its Zombie spell, instead. By paying a skull, they can place the card in their tableau as an extension of their hand allowing them to use that card's value for many turns in the future.\n\nIn these ways, players create &quot;cliques&quot; of linked contacts in and among the four cocktail lounges (Lava, Cocoa, Tiki, and Neptune) trying to schmooze their way to the Jivecat contacts that score points. The contacts are limited though, so several players may be angling for a specific Jivecat.\n\nDuring play, a series of Skull Cards allow players to gain skull token reward that power their voodoo spells, and a Trend Card track presents players with monkey rewards for achieving specific contact configurations. The Trend cards also provide special bonus abilities to the players if they can maintain the required configurations.\n\nEach player has a martini glass to hold the contact chips and scores are kept through hanging cocktail monkeys on the rim of the player's glass. Orange monkeys are 1 point and blue monkeys are 5 points.\n\nGame end is triggered when one player reaches fifteen monkey points. The round is completed, bonus monkeys are rewarded for trends that have been maintained, and the player with the most monkeys wins.\n\nTo add to the cocktail themed fun, each card also has a different cocktail recipe for adult players to mix and enjoy.", "['Card Game', 'Fighting'] ['Card Play Conflict Resolution', 'Deck, Bag, and Pool Building', 'Hand Management', 'Solo \\\\/ Solitaire Game'] A fast-paced, card-based clash of Swords and sorcery for one to two players.", "['Aviation \\\\/ Flight', 'Wargame', 'World War I'] ['Action Queue', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simultaneous Action Selection'] All-encompassing game of WWI air battles in detail.", "['Deduction'] ['Cooperative Game'] A short teaser game with only few riddles for 1-6 players.\n\nYou followed the invitation to a new premiere in town.

Another 32 cards are Action cards which are used to create the scorelines for each match. The final card is a summary list of what the Action cards can be used for.\n\nAll the teams are randomly divided between the players. These are kept face-down on the table in front of the player until required.\n\nEach group is played match by match. The players controlling the four teams in Group 1: South Africa, Mexico, Uruguay and France now reveal those Team cards.\n\nEach team card is coloured according to the national football team strip, it also shows the national flag and a note stating their best performance ever achieved in any World Cup tournament. There is also a grey rectangle with the number of cards that team receives in the group stage - this is always 7 or 8. There is also a 2 Goal and 3 Goal symbol, sometimes covered by a cross. Any crossed symbol means that this particular team cannot use that type of card to it's full potential e.g, Argentina have the 3 Goal symbol crossed but the 2 Goal symbol uncrossed, therefore Argentina can only play a 3 Goal card as a 2 Goal card.\n The number of cards and the status of the 3 and 2 goal symbols distinguishes the better teams from the lesser teams. Brazil, for example, have 8 cards and no crossed symbols which gives them the maximum options; New Zealand have 7 cards and both symbols are crossed which gives them the fewest options. Despite the small difference between the various teams, the better teams generally have a better chance. However, the differences are not as great as in The World Cup Board Game.\nPlay continues with the first group games being played in the order on the tournament format in the rules. The first game is South Africa v. Mexico, so each player controlling those teams play from 1 to 4 cards out of that teams' hand. The number of cards should be kept secret until both players have chosen, then they are both revealed. Goals are scored for that team in that match, Defences, Fouls and Offsides can reduce goals whereas Penalties and multiple Attacks add goals. Any spare Attacks and penalties require a card draw from the unused deck to see if they can be turned into goals.\n\nEach match is resolved in the same way. All scores from all games are recorded - best to use the pre-formatted scoresheet on the www.gamesfortheworld.co.uk/Downloads web page.\n\nThe KO stages are played differently, more akin to the Board game. The Round of 16 is split into 2 sessions with 3 cards dealt to each player involved, irrespective of the number of teams. Cards can be played on any active team until the deck is exhausted and all cards played.\n\nFrom the Quarter-Finals onwards all games are played in each round simultaneously.\nDraws are resolved by card draws to determine if goals have been scored.\n\nEasy to play and a great sequel to the Board game.", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Area Movement', 'Area-Impulse', 'Dice Rolling', 'Scenario \\\\/ Mission \\\\/ Campaign Game', 'Simulation'] Tigers in the Mist, Ardennes Offensive, The Battle of the Bulge, December 16 - 22, 1944, this game simulates the early stages of the German offensive in the Ardennes section of Western Europe (Germany, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg) in December of 1944. Historically, the Germans planned to break through the thin American defenses in this area, cross the Meuse River, and seize the port of Antwerp in Belgium.

The Battle of the Bulge had begun.\n\nDuring the first week of the battle, three German armies attacked vigorously and relentlessly in an attempt to reach the Meuse River, the major geographical obstacle between them and the great port of Antwerp on the northern coast of Belgium. Stubborn resistance by outnumbered American forces in the difficult terrain of the Ardennes canceled out much of the initial material advantages and surprise the Germans enjoyed.

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.\n\n10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.\n\nSix weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.\n\nBut, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course. But which ones would have changed the outcome?\n\nGame Scale:\nGame Turn: 2 days\nHex: 6.8 miles / 11 kilometer\nUnits: Battalion to Army\n\nGame Inventory:\nOne 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet\nOne 17 x 22&quot; full color mapsheet\nThree dual-side printed countersheets (720 1/2&quot; counters)\nOne 32-page Victory in the West rulebook\nOne 8-page Victory in the West Example of Play booklet\nOne 4-page Victory in the West Design Notes booklet\nFive dual-side printed Player Aid Cards\nOne 10-sided dice\n\nSolitaire Playability: High\nComplexity Level: Medium\nPlayers: 2 or more\nPlaying Time: 2-20 hours\n\nDESIGNER: David James Ritchie\nDEVELOPER: Kevin Boylan and Gene Billingsley\nART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.\n\nThe game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.\n\nFoz do Arouce, 15th March 1811\nThe fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.\n\nFuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811\nOn the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.\n\nEl Bodon 25th September 1811\nThe fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.\n\nFuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:\n\n    A 59 x 40 cm map,\n    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,\n    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.\n\n\nUnits : Regiments and brigades\nMap scale : 500 m/hex.\nTurn : 120 minutes\n\nComplexity : 6 / 9\n\nBilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).", "['Animals', 'Nautical'] ['Tile Placement'] Swim, spawn, and eat shrimp while avoiding sharks!

The Survivors must defend four key locations from Walkers &ndash; the Farm, the Prison, the Town and the Highway &ndash; in order to stay alive. The game board is assembled at random for each game, providing for variability in the locations; a 25-card resource deck &ndash; containing either Equipment, Allies, Food or Ammunition &ndash; is placed at random on one of the locations.\n\nWalkers and other calamities are triggered in different locations by a 48-card Event deck (every card is unique!), which players draw from each round. They must then figure out how to minimize the effects of these Events, using dice to resolve combat and determine the outcome of some events. Survivors can work together to combine their combat abilities or split up to cover more ground. If the Survivors don't clear the Walkers out of a location, they'll lose resources &ndash; and if any resource deck runs out, the players lose the game. Thus, players need to keep the Walkers at bay while not using up too many resources themselves.\n\nUnlike most cooperative games, The Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes a leadership role that a player can take for one or more rounds. Each player character has a unique leadership ability that provides a bonus while that character is in charge.\n\nThe Walking Dead Board Game: The Best Defense includes two gameplay modes. In the &quot;Beginner&quot; mode, players share all information on their Event cards so that the leader and others can take everything happening in the game into consideration. In &quot;Expert&quot; mode, players may not share their Event cards, which means that leaders might make decisions that are detrimental to other players &ndash; but those players can defy the leader (for a cost) and make their own moves. Why would they do this?\n\nIn addition to just trying to stay alive, each player has a secret &quot;Ulterior Motive&quot; card that specifies a mission for that player. If he completes that mission, then he earns a partial victory, even if the Survivors as a group would otherwise lose.

In search of the philosopher's stone, recipes must be researched and resources mined. The competitive sandbox game combines various mechanics, such as dice rolling while fighting, deck building while recipe exploration, grid movement on a modular game board, pick up and delivery while resource mining, resource management while crafting items and area control by creating little helpers, the Homunculi.\n\nMateria Prima is a highly immersive game about alchemy and how to create the Philosopher's Stone. Each alchemist must look for long lost recipes and research in old libraries of the cities to create the stone. The elements for this must be mined on hexes, which are distributed on the game board. Alchemy has a centuries-old tradition and its masters come from families, schools and guilds whose history is as old as the records that tell of them. An Alchemist is therefore not a blank sheet of paper. Some have a special alchemical codex, others act out of love or revenge, and there are those who have gone mad by the power of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone and want to plunge the world into chaos. Every single biography results in a secret quest. However, this secret should be guarded, since the competitors will exploit every weakness. The game can only be completed when the first one with the help of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone fulfills this quest.\n\nThe two central game mechanics are a turn and action based move system and a resource based crafting system.\n\n     The alchemists have a certain number of possible actions (moving, fighting, dismantling, buying, transmuting, etc.) on each turn, depending on the hexes they are currently in. Both the possibilities of action and the number of actions increase in the course of the game, depending on which equipment or homunculi an alchemist transmutes. This immediately leads to the second game mechanic, the crafting system.\n     Not only the Philosopher's Stone, but also equipment and homunculi are transmuted with a crafting system. The required elements can be mined on the game board and then improved or transmuted. Meet the enemies heavily armed with sword and shield! Be the wisest and defeat your enemies with the power of alchemy! Be cunning and lead your opponents on the wrong track! Be a strategist and lead your helpers into battle. With the crafting system you turn the game into your game. \n\n\n-description from designer\n\nVideo-link for the assemble of the card-board-tray:\nhttp://www.materiaprimaboardgame.com/.cm4all/uproc.php/0/.VID_20190519_155022.mp4/video.mp4?_=16af45436e9", "['Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Science Fiction'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Modular Board', 'Variable Player Powers'] Dark Uprising is a fresh take on Necromunda for both veterans and newcomers alike.

A roll-to-hit system enables air and (optional) naval combat to scale from the small dogfights of the Fokker Scourge to the mighty clash of dreadnoughts at Jutland. On land, corps entrench by flipping which opens up an in-hex dimension for every trench battle to simulate the tactical ebb and flow that animated the front even during strategic &quot;stalemate&quot;.\n\nSince victory hinges on territorial control, the opposing sides feed men into the mill hoping to win a war of attrition before accumulated demoralization triggers a domestic political crisis to upset their balance. The prospect of a &quot;breakthrough&quot; to the green fields beyond motivates ceaseless attacks, but it's ephemeral until tanks and planes arrive in numbers. The presence of specific admirals and generals, including the U-boat ace Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere, makes the game personal.\n\nA haggle-based diplomacy system enables history buffs to recreate the land-swap politics of the period, or players can opt for a simpler, streamlined schedule of neutral entry with a dash of randomness added for surprise. Production is as simple as 1-2-3 to avoid excessive math while enabling players to comprehend the &quot;cost&quot; of their losses.

During battles, players draw a hand and decide what cards to play based on what their ship and crew enable them to play. They roll for the actions of their enemy and resolve the damage.

Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.\n\nBarcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.\n\nIn more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.\n\nDuring the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct.

The goal is to sink enemy shipping, perform special missions, accumulate experience, and manage crew stress.\n\nThe American submarine campaign in the Pacific during World War II was a major contributor to the ultimate defeat of Japan. During the war, American submarines comprised less than two percent of the U.S. Navy, but sank almost 60 percent of the Japanese merchant marine and more than 30 percent of Japan's navy, including eight aircraft carriers. Gato Leader moves the Leader series to Pacific waters, letting players lead a group of American submarines against the Empire of Japan. The core system of the game is built on U-Boat Leader and will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to get into the game quickly. A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you send your boats to the distant, better-defended, merchant-rich Japanese Home Waters, or do you hit the convoys supplying the far-flung Japanese bases? You can spend Special Operations Points to upgrade your submarines, concentrate intelligence resources, and send your submarines on special missions, such as mine-laying and hunting the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nWhen a patrolling submarine encounters an enemy force the action then shifts to the tactical display where the submarine tries to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to identify the ships and decide which ones are worth firing torpedoes or guns at.

The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 gave new territories the right to &ldquo;popular sovereignty,&rdquo; allowing residents to choose whether or not to allow slavery. Within months the stream of settlers to Kansas was swelled by parties of sponsored abolitionists and pro-slavers, all more intent on fighting one another than building a new state. Bushwhacks and gun battles punctuated maneuvers by rival legislatures elected through massive fraud. It would not die out entirely until statehood in January 1861. The new state&rsquo;s senators swung the US Senate irretrievably against the South, ensuring the continuation of secession started by the election of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThe core of the game is the card system. Each card describes an important event, person, or factor in the conflict, and triggers associated actions in the game.

The game uses a simplified version of the D-Day at Omaha Beach system.\n\n\n\n(from Publisher website :)Operation Jubilee: Dieppe, August 1942 (OJ) is a purpose-designed solitaire game, by John Butterfield, simulating the disastrous Commonwealth raid against the German-held French port of Dieppe on 19 August 1942. It uses an evolution of his well-liked system from our earlier boxed game release: D-Day on Omaha Beach.\nHistorically, a mixed force of Canadian troops and tanks and British Commandos landed on several beaches along a 16-mile stretch of coast, with a variety of objectives. While the commando raids on the flanks met with some success, the major action against Dieppe was a costly failure. It didn&rsquo;t come close to achieving its objectives, and over 75 percent of that landing force were killed or captured. You control the CW forces assaulting the beaches and struggling to achieve their objectives against intense German resistance. The game system controls the German forces that oppose you.\n\nThe overall 34x22&rdquo; large-hex map, which is cut in half and reassembled into a 17&quot;x42&quot; play area, consists of three sector maps: the main map showing the French port of Dieppe and surrounding areas, and two smaller maps portraying coastal areas east and west of the main map.

The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.\n\nAs the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.\n\nIf the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.\n\nPuzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding.

A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.\n\nPlay continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.\n\nThe game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead.

Head on over to the Jurassic Hunting Grounds to capture dinosaurs for your ranch by luring them with their favorite foods. Watch out for tar pits spreading on your precious land, reducing the number of dinosaurs that can live on your ranch.\n\nFill your ranch with the most valuable dinosaurs to become the top rancher and win!\n\nIn Dino Dude Ranch, players roll custom dice each turn in order to collect resources used to capture dinosaurs from the Jurassic Hunting Grounds. After dinosaurs are captured from the hunting grounds, new dinosaurs are randomly selected to replace them. Players continue to collect resources and purchase dinosaurs until all of the dinosaurs have been captured from the Jurassic Hunting Grounds or until one rancher has completely filled their ranch. Players' ranches will be filled faster if they roll tar pits during resource collection. These tar pits not only take up precious space that could be used for housing dinosaurs but they are also worth negative points at the end of the game.\n\nPlayers may also choose to purchase cards, which can be used to produce more resources, collect free dinosaurs, and add or remove tar pits from ranches.\n\nThis easy to learn game is a fantastic introduction to set collection/resource management games and is designed to be engaging for families, gamers, and non-gamers alike.", "['Wargame', 'World War II'] ['Dice Rolling', 'Hexagon Grid', 'Simulation'] Early in the morning of May 10, 1940, under the Codeword Danzig, Fallschirmj&auml;ger from the 7th Flieger Division and 22nd Luftlande executed surprise landings at Den Haag, on the road to Rotterdam and against the Fortress of Eben Emael in order to facilitate German Army Group B's feint advance in Belgium, while the main attack was conducted by stronger Army Group A led by seven panzer divisions from the Ardennes, through a terrain believed uncrossable to armor units. France and the UK reacted immediately, activating the Dyle-Breda Plan, and thus committing their best forces directly into the trap. Then in June the evacuation of Dunkirk was a partial success, but the battle for France was over with an astonishing German victory. Four years elapsed before the Western Allies would come back to the continent and thus finally defeat Germany.\n\nBlocks in the West (BITW) recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the European Theater Front from the invasion of France until the collapse of the Nazi regimen in May 1945. BITW is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the operational level. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II on the Western Front. The game is recommended for two, three or four players: one/two control the Western Allies and the other one/two control Germany and Italy. The game is imminently suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, playing with Fog of War is mandatory.\n\nDeveloped on a wooden blocks and cubes system over an astonishing 124x87cm full-laminated multicolor map board, Blocks in the West includes no paper components other than the manual. All of the over 900 wooden/plastic components/stickers have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted A buratto, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories. In terms of scale, a hexagon is approximately 44 miles (70 km) across, a game turn is one month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally a corps) of ca. 30,000 men, 300 Tanks or 300 planes depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc\n\nThe rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time. The basic game rules introduce the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember. Then the advanced game rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of fuel and the advanced production system. Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, optional rules can be added as desired; these include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, and Parachute Assaults.\n\nBlocks in the West can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the East and Blocks in Afrika.", "['Collectible Components', 'Fighting', 'Miniatures', 'Movies \\\\/ TV \\\\/ Radio theme'] ['Action Points', 'Dice Rolling', 'Grid Movement', 'Variable Player Powers'] &quot;Thank you for being a friend.&quot; Go on a sassy, retro adventure with some of your favorite Golden Girls in the ultimate Pop! battle.\n\nIn the Funkoverse Strategy Game, you combine your favorite characters and go head-to-head in exciting game scenarios.\n\nEach turn, you select one of your characters and perform two actions.

Players use a small allotment of gold coins at the beginning of the game to select combinations of weapons, chariots, or drivers.

Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.  Steeped in the ancient legends of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic heritage and royal past, these unique games of pure strategy are appreciated by young and old alike.\n\nTailten Games won the Games Magazine award for BEST ABSTRACT GAME 2006; the  Spiele f&uuml;r Zwei - Spiele Akademie 2005 (Austria); Index 100 - Showcase 2005 in Ireland; and the award for 'Best Irish-Style Traditional Gift' 2005 in Ireland for Project Kells.\n\nAccording to the designer, Murray Heasman,&quot;The game takes five minutes to learn, yet a lifetime to master.&quot; The sheer beauty of this game alone makes it a gift to treasure--but the three separate games  each pose a daunting task for any strategic or abstract gamer.\n\nIn all there are eight variants to stimulate the mind, so take it to your own level.  From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.\n\nYou&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.\n\n\n     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===\n     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...\n\n\n\n    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.\n\n\nThis is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara."]
